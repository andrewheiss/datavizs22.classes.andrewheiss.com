### Questions to reflect on

*(Remember, you don't need to answer all of these—or even any of them! These are just here to help guide your thinking.)*

- Why is it important to visualize variables and data?
- What does it mean to map data to graph aesthetics?
- What data was mapped to which aesthetics in Rosling's video?

## Other resources

[This tutorial by Cédric Scherer](https://www.cedricscherer.com/2019/05/17/the-evolution-of-a-ggplot-ep.-1/) is an excellent demonstration of the grammar of graphics and the sequential nature of building up a plot layer-by-layer.

**Fun fact**: If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while going through the slides, you can see a list of special slide-specific commands.
