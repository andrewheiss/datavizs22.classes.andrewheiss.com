514,PLAYING PILGRIMS,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,"" grumbled Jo, lying",Little Women
514,on the rug.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's so dreadful to be poor!"" sighed Meg, looking down at her old",Little Women
514,dress.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty",Little Women
514,"things, and other girls nothing at all,"" added little Amy, with an",Little Women
514,injured sniff.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""We've got Father and Mother, and each other,"" said Beth contentedly",Little Women
514,from her corner.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the,Little Women
514,"cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly, ""We haven't got",Little Women
514,"Father, and shall not have him for a long time."" She didn't say",Little Women
514,"""perhaps never,"" but each silently added it, thinking of Father far",Little Women
514,"away, where the fighting was.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone, ""You know",Little Women
514,the reason Mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was,Little Women
514,because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone; and she thinks we,Little Women
514,"ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are suffering so in",Little Women
514,"the army.  We can't do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and",Little Women
514,"ought to do it gladly.  But I am afraid I don't,"" and Meg shook her",Little Women
514,"head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good.  We've",Little Women
514,"each got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving",Little Women
514,"that.  I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want",Little Women
514,"to buy _Undine and Sintran_ for myself.  I've wanted it so long,"" said",Little Women
514,"Jo, who was a bookworm.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I planned to spend mine in new music,"" said Beth, with a little sigh,",Little Women
514,which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle-holder.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils; I really need",Little Women
514,"them,"" said Amy decidedly.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish us to",Little Women
514,"give up everything.  Let's each buy what we want, and have a little",Little Women
514,"fun; I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it,"" cried Jo, examining the",Little Women
514,heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I know I do--teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when I'm",Little Women
514,"longing to enjoy myself at home,"" began Meg, in the complaining tone",Little Women
514,again.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You don't have half such a hard time as I do,"" said Jo. ""How would you",Little Women
514,"like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps",Little Women
514,"you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to",Little Women
514,"fly out the window or cry?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things",Little Women
514,"tidy is the worst work in the world.  It makes me cross, and my hands",Little Women
514,"get so stiff, I can't practice well at all."" And Beth looked at her",Little Women
514,rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I don't believe any of you suffer as I do,"" cried Amy, ""for you don't",Little Women
514,"have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you",Little Women
514,"don't know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your",Little Women
514,"father if he isn't rich, and insult you when your nose isn't nice.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""If you mean libel, I'd say so, and not talk about labels, as if Papa",Little Women
514,"was a pickle bottle,"" advised Jo, laughing.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I know what I mean, and you needn't be statirical about it. It's",Little Women
514,"proper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary,"" returned Amy,",Little Women
514,with dignity.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't peck at one another, children.  Don't you wish we had the money",Little Women
514,"Papa lost when we were little, Jo?  Dear me! How happy and good we'd",Little Women
514,"be, if we had no worries!"" said Meg, who could remember better times.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the",Little Women
514,"King children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in",Little Women
514,"spite of their money.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""So I did, Beth.  Well, I think we are.  For though we do have to work,",Little Women
514,"we make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Jo does use such slang words!"" observed Amy, with a reproving look at",Little Women
514,the long figure stretched on the rug.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began to",Little Women
514,whistle.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't, Jo.  It's so boyish!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That's why I do it.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I detest rude, unladylike girls!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Birds in their little nests agree,"" sang Beth, the peacemaker, with",Little Women
514,"such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the",Little Women
514,"""pecking"" ended for that time.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,"" said Meg, beginning to",Little Women
514,"lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. ""You are old enough to leave off",Little Women
514,"boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine.  It didn't matter so",Little Women
514,"much when you were a little girl, but now you are so tall, and turn up",Little Women
514,"your hair, you should remember that you are a young lady.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm not!   And if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll wear it in two",Little Women
514,"tails till I'm twenty,"" cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down",Little Women
514,"a chestnut mane.  ""I hate to think I've got to grow up, and be Miss",Little Women
514,"March, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China Aster!  It's",Little Women
514,"bad enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boy's games and work and",Little Women
514,manners!  I can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy.  And,Little Women
514,"it's worse than ever now, for I'm dying to go and fight with Papa. And",Little Women
514,"I can only stay home and knit, like a poky old woman!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,And Jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like,Little Women
514,"castanets, and her ball bounded across the room.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Poor Jo!  It's too bad, but it can't be helped.  So you must try to be",Little Women
514,"contented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us",Little Women
514,"girls,"" said Beth, stroking the rough head with a hand that all the",Little Women
514,dish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its,Little Women
514,touch.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""As for you, Amy,"" continued Meg, ""you are altogether too particular",Little Women
514,"and prim.  Your airs are funny now, but you'll grow up an affected",Little Women
514,"little goose, if you don't take care. I like your nice manners and",Little Women
514,"refined ways of speaking, when you don't try to be elegant.  But your",Little Women
514,"absurd words are as bad as Jo's slang.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""If Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?"" asked Beth,",Little Women
514,ready to share the lecture.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You're a dear, and nothing else,"" answered Meg warmly, and no one",Little Women
514,"contradicted her, for the 'Mouse' was the pet of the family.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As young readers like to know 'how people look', we will take this",Little Women
514,"moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat",Little Women
514,"knitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly",Little Women
514,"without, and the fire crackled cheerfully within.  It was a comfortable",Little Women
514,"room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain, for a",Little Women
514,"good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses,",Little Women
514,"chrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a",Little Women
514,pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being",Little Women
514,"plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair, a sweet",Little Women
514,"mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old",Little Women
514,"Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt, for she",Little Women
514,"never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very",Little Women
514,"much in her way.  She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp,",Little Women
514,"gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce,",Little Women
514,"funny, or thoughtful.  Her long, thick hair was her one beauty, but it",Little Women
514,"was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way.  Round shoulders",Little Women
514,"had Jo, big hands and feet, a flyaway look to her clothes, and the",Little Women
514,uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a,Little Women
514,"woman and didn't like it. Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her,",Little Women
514,"was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy",Little Women
514,"manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression which was seldom",Little Women
514,"disturbed.  Her father called her 'Little Miss Tranquility', and the",Little Women
514,"name suited her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy world of",Little Women
514,"her own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved.",Little Women
514,"Amy, though the youngest, was a most important person, in her own",Little Women
514,"opinion at least.  A regular snow maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow",Little Women
514,"hair curling on her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying",Little Women
514,herself like a young lady mindful of her manners.  What the characters,Little Women
514,of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The clock struck six and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair",Little Women
514,of slippers down to warm.  Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a,Little Women
514,"good effect upon the girls, for Mother was coming, and everyone",Little Women
514,"brightened to welcome her.  Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the",Little Women
514,"lamp, Amy got out of the easy chair without being asked, and Jo forgot",Little Women
514,how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the,Little Women
514,blaze.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""They are quite worn out.  Marmee must have a new pair.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I thought I'd get her some with my dollar,"" said Beth.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, I shall!"" cried Amy.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm the oldest,"" began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided, ""I'm the man",Little Women
514,"of the family now Papa is away, and I shall provide the slippers, for",Little Women
514,"he told me to take special care of Mother while he was gone.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll tell you what we'll do,"" said Beth, ""let's each get her something",Little Women
514,"for Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That's like you, dear!  What will we get?"" exclaimed Jo.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Everyone thought soberly for a minute, then Meg announced, as if the",Little Women
514,"idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, ""I shall give",Little Women
514,"her a nice pair of gloves.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Army shoes, best to be had,"" cried Jo.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed,"" said Beth.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll get a little bottle of cologne.  She likes it, and it won't cost",Little Women
514,"much, so I'll have some left to buy my pencils,"" added Amy.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How will we give the things?"" asked Meg.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles.",Little Women
514,"Don't you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?"" answered Jo.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the chair",Little Women
514,"with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the",Little Women
514,"presents, with a kiss.  I liked the things and the kisses, but it was",Little Women
514,"dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles,""",Little Women
514,"said Beth, who was toasting her face and the bread for tea at the same",Little Women
514,time.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then",Little Women
514,"surprise her.  We must go shopping tomorrow afternoon, Meg. There is so",Little Women
514,"much to do about the play for Christmas night,"" said Jo, marching up",Little Women
514,"and down, with her hands behind her back, and her nose in the air.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I don't mean to act any more after this time.  I'm getting too old for",Little Women
514,"such things,"" observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about",Little Women
514,'dressing-up' frolics.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You won't stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown",Little Women
514,"with your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best",Little Women
514,"actress we've got, and there'll be an end of everything if you quit the",Little Women
514,"boards,"" said Jo.  ""We ought to rehearse tonight.  Come here, Amy, and",Little Women
514,"do the fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I can't help it.  I never saw anyone faint, and I don't choose to make",Little Women
514,"myself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do.  If I can go down",Little Women
514,"easily, I'll drop.  If I can't, I shall fall into a chair and be",Little Women
514,"graceful.  I don't care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,""",Little Women
514,"returned Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen",Little Women
514,because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain,Little Women
514,of the piece.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Do it this way.  Clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room,",Little Women
514,"crying frantically, 'Roderigo! Save me! Save me!'"" and away went Jo,",Little Women
514,with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Amy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and",Little Women
514,"jerked herself along as if she went by machinery, and her ""Ow!"" was",Little Women
514,more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish.,Little Women
514,"Jo gave a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let",Little Women
514,"her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest. ""It's no use!  Do",Little Women
514,"the best you can when the time comes, and if the audience laughs, don't",Little Women
514,"blame me.  Come on, Meg.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Then things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech",Little Women
514,"of two pages without a single break.  Hagar, the witch, chanted an",Little Women
514,"awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird",Little Women
514,"effect.  Roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and Hugo died in",Little Women
514,"agonies of remorse and arsenic, with a wild, ""Ha! Ha!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's the best we've had yet,"" said Meg, as the dead villain sat up and",Little Women
514,rubbed his elbows.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I don't see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo.",Little Women
514,"You're a regular Shakespeare!"" exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that",Little Women
514,her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not quite,"" replied Jo modestly.  ""I do think _The Witches Curse, an",Little Women
514,"Operatic Tragedy_ is rather a nice thing, but I'd like to try",Little Women
514,"_Macbeth_, if we only had a trapdoor for Banquo.  I always wanted to do",Little Women
514,"the killing part.  'Is that a dagger that I see before me?"" muttered",Little Women
514,"Jo, rolling her eyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous",Little Women
514,tragedian do.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, it's the toasting fork, with Mother's shoe on it instead of the",Little Women
514,"bread.  Beth's stage-struck!"" cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended in a",Little Women
514,general burst of laughter.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Glad to find you so merry, my girls,"" said a cheery voice at the door,",Little Women
514,"and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady with a",Little Women
514,'can I help you' look about her which was truly delightful. She was not,Little Women
514,"elegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the",Little Women
514,gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in,Little Women
514,the world.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, dearies, how have you got on today?  There was so much to do,",Little Women
514,"getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow, that I didn't come home to",Little Women
514,"dinner.  Has anyone called, Beth?  How is your cold, Meg?  Jo, you look",Little Women
514,"tired to death.  Come and kiss me, baby.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things,Little Women
514,"off, her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy chair, drew Amy",Little Women
514,"to her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day.  The",Little Women
514,"girls flew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own",Little Women
514,"way.  Meg arranged the tea table, Jo brought wood and set chairs,",Little Women
514,"dropping, over-turning, and clattering everything she touched.  Beth",Little Women
514,"trotted to and fro between parlor kitchen, quiet and busy, while Amy",Little Women
514,"gave directions to everyone, as she sat with her hands folded.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly",Little Women
514,"happy face, ""I've got a treat for you after supper.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"A quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth",Little Women
514,"clapped her hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo tossed up",Little Women
514,"her napkin, crying, ""A letter!  A letter!  Three cheers for Father!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, a nice long letter.  He is well, and thinks he shall get through",Little Women
514,the cold season better than we feared.  He sends all sorts of loving,Little Women
514,"wishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls,"" said Mrs.",Little Women
514,"March, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Hurry and get done!  Don't stop to quirk your little finger and simper",Little Women
514,"over your plate, Amy,"" cried Jo, choking on her tea and dropping her",Little Women
514,"bread, butter side down, on the carpet in her haste to get at the treat.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Beth ate no more, but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood",Little Women
514,"over the delight to come, till the others were ready.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I think it was so splendid in Father to go as chaplain when he was too",Little Women
514,"old to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier,"" said Meg",Little Women
514,warmly.,Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,"""When will he come home, Marmee?"" asked Beth, with a little quiver in",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick.  He will stay and do his",Little Women
514,"work faithfully as long as he can, and we won't ask for him back a",Little Women
514,"minute sooner than he can be spared.  Now come and hear the letter.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"They all drew to the fire, Mother in the big chair with Beth at her",Little Women
514,"feet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo leaning on",Little Women
514,"the back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter",Little Women
514,should happen to be touching.  Very few letters were written in those,Little Women
514,"hard times that were not touching, especially those which fathers sent",Little Women
514,"home.  In this one little was said of the hardships endured, the",Little Women
514,"dangers faced, or the homesickness conquered. It was a cheerful,",Little Women
514,"hopeful letter, full of lively descriptions of camp life, marches, and",Little Women
514,"military news, and only at the end did the writer's heart over-flow",Little Women
514,with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Give them all of my dear love and a kiss.  Tell them I think of them",Little Women
514,"by day, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in their",Little Women
514,affection at all times.  A year seems very long to wait before I see,Little Women
514,"them, but remind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these",Little Women
514,hard days need not be wasted.  I know they will remember all I said to,Little Women
514,"them, that they will be loving children to you, will do their duty",Little Women
514,"faithfully, fight their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves",Little Women
514,so beautifully that when I come back to them I may be fonder and,Little Women
514,"prouder than ever of my little women."" Everybody sniffed when they came",Little Women
514,to that part.  Jo wasn't ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the,Little Women
514,"end of her nose, and Amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she",Little Women
514,"hid her face on her mother's shoulder and sobbed out, ""I am a selfish",Little Women
514,"girl!  But I'll truly try to be better, so he mayn't be disappointed in",Little Women
514,"me by-and-by.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,harder task than facing a rebel or two down South.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Beth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army sock and",Little Women
514,"began to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing the duty that",Little Women
514,"lay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all",Little Women
514,that Father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy,Little Women
514,coming home.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Mrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo's words, by saying in her",Little Women
514,"cheery voice, ""Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrims Progress",Little Women
514,when you were little things?  Nothing delighted you more than to have,Little Women
514,"me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens, give you hats and",Little Women

514,said Meg.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I don't remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the cellar",Little Women
514,"and the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the",Little Women
514,"top.  If I wasn't too old for such things, I'd rather like to play it",Little Women
514,"over again,"" said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things",Little Women
514,at the mature age of twelve.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are",Little Women
514,"playing all the time in one way or another.  Our burdens are here, our",Little Women
514,"road is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness is the",Little Women
514,guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace,Little Women
514,"which is a true Celestial City.  Now, my little pilgrims, suppose you",Little Women
514,"begin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how far on you can",Little Women
514,"get before Father comes home.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Really, Mother?  Where are our bundles?"" asked Amy, who was a very",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth. I rather",Little Women
514,"think she hasn't got any,"" said her mother.",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,"pianos, and being afraid of people.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull,Little Women

514,"They talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table, then",Little Women
514,"out came the four little work baskets, and the needles flew as the",Little Women
514,"girls made sheets for Aunt March.  It was uninteresting sewing, but",Little Women
514,tonight no one grumbled.  They adopted Jo's plan of dividing the long,Little Women
514,"seams into four parts, and calling the quarters Europe, Asia, Africa,",Little Women
514,"and America, and in that way got on capitally, especially when they",Little Women
514,talked about the different countries as they stitched their way through,Little Women
514,them.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"At nine they stopped work, and sang, as usual, before they went to bed.",Little Women
514,"No one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano, but she had",Little Women
514,a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant,Little Women
514,accompaniment to the simple songs they sang.  Meg had a voice like a,Little Women
514,"flute, and she and her mother led the little choir.  Amy chirped like a",Little Women
514,"cricket, and Jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will, always",Little Women
514,coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoiled the,Little Women
514,most pensive tune.  They had always done this from the time they could,Little Women

514,CHAPTER TWO,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,A MERRY CHRISTMAS,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. No,Little Women
514,"stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much",Little Women
514,"disappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down",Little Women
514,because it was crammed so full of goodies.  Then she remembered her,Little Women
514,"mother's promise and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a",Little Women
514,"little crimson-covered book.  She knew it very well, for it was that",Little Women
514,"beautiful old story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it",Little Women
514,was a true guidebook for any pilgrim going on a long journey.  She woke,Little Women
514,"Meg with a ""Merry Christmas,"" and bade her see what was under her",Little Women
514,"pillow.  A green-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside,",Little Women
514,"and a few words written by their mother, which made their one present",Little Women
514,very precious in their eyes.  Presently Beth and Amy woke to rummage,Little Women
514,"and find their little books also, one dove-colored, the other blue, and",Little Women
514,"all sat looking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy",Little Women
514,with the coming day.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"In spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature,",Little Women
514,"which unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo, who loved",Little Women
514,"her very tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently",Little Women
514,given.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Girls,"" said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her",Little Women
514,"to the two little night-capped ones in the room beyond, ""Mother wants",Little Women
514,"us to read and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once.",Little Women
514,"We used to be faithful about it, but since Father went away and all",Little Women
514,"this war trouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things.  You can",Little Women
514,"do as you please, but I shall keep my book on the table here and read a",Little Women
514,"little every morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good",Little Women
514,"and help me through the day.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Then she opened her new book and began to read.  Jo put her arm round,Little Women
514,"her and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression",Little Women
514,so seldom seen on her restless face.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How good Meg is!  Come, Amy, let's do as they do.  I'll help you with",Little Women
514,"the hard words, and they'll explain things if we don't understand,""",Little Women
514,"whispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her",Little Women
514,sisters' example.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm glad mine is blue,"" said Amy.  and then the rooms were very still",Little Women
514,"while the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to",Little Women
514,touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Where is Mother?"" asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for",Little Women
514,"their gifts, half an hour later.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Goodness only knows.  Some poor creeter came a-beggin', and your ma",Little Women
514,went straight off to see what was needed.  There never was such a woman,Little Women
514,"for givin' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin',"" replied Hannah,",Little Women
514,"who had lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by",Little Women
514,them all more as a friend than a servant.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""She will be back soon, I think, so fry your cakes, and have everything",Little Women
514,"ready,"" said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a",Little Women
514,"basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper",Little Women
514,"time.  ""Why, where is Amy's bottle of cologne?"" she added, as the",Little Women
514,little flask did not appear.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on",Little Women
514,"it, or some such notion,"" replied Jo, dancing about the room to take",Little Women
514,the first stiffness off the new army slippers.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How nice my handkerchiefs look, don't they?  Hannah washed and ironed",Little Women
514,"them for me, and I marked them all myself,"" said Beth, looking proudly",Little Women
514,at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Bless the child!  She's gone and put 'Mother' on them instead of 'M.",Little Women
514,"March'.  How funny!"" cried Jo, taking one up.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Isn't that right?  I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg's",Little Women
514,"initials are M.M., and I don't want anyone to use these but Marmee,""",Little Women
514,"said Beth, looking troubled.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's all right, dear, and a very pretty idea, quite sensible too, for",Little Women
514,"no one can ever mistake now.  It will please her very much, I know,""",Little Women
514,"said Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""There's Mother.  Hide the basket, quick!"" cried Jo, as a door slammed",Little Women
514,and steps sounded in the hall.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Amy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters",Little Women
514,all waiting for her.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?"" asked Meg,",Little Women
514,"surprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so",Little Women
514,early.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't laugh at me, Jo!  I didn't mean anyone should know till the time",Little Women
514,"came.  I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I",Little Women
514,"gave all my money to get it, and I'm truly trying not to be selfish any",Little Women
514,"more.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap",Little Women
514,"one, and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget",Little Women
514,"herself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her 'a",Little Women
514,"trump', while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to",Little Women
514,ornament the stately bottle.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about",Little Women
514,"being good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the",Little Women
514,"minute I was up, and I'm so glad, for mine is the handsomest now.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa, and the",Little Women
514,"girls to the table, eager for breakfast.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Merry Christmas, Marmee!  Many of them!  Thank you for our books.  We",Little Women
514,"read some, and mean to every day,"" they all cried in chorus.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Merry Christmas, little daughters!  I'm glad you began at once, and",Little Women
514,hope you will keep on.  But I want to say one word before we sit down.,Little Women
514,Not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby.,Little Women
514,"Six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they",Little Women
514,"have no fire.  There is nothing to eat over there, and the oldest boy",Little Women
514,"came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold.  My girls, will",Little Women
514,"you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a",Little Women
514,"minute no one spoke, only a minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously, ""I'm",Little Women
514,"so glad you came before we began!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?"" asked",Little Women
514,Beth eagerly.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I shall take the cream and the muffings,"" added Amy, heroically giving",Little Women
514,up the article she most liked.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one",Little Women
514,big plate.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I thought you'd do it,"" said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. ""You",Little Women
514,"shall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and",Little Women
514,"milk for breakfast, and make it up at dinnertime.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"They were soon ready, and the procession set out.  Fortunately it was",Little Women
514,"early, and they went through back streets, so few people saw them, and",Little Women
514,no one laughed at the queer party.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"A poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire,",Little Women
514,"ragged bedclothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group of pale,",Little Women
514,"hungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Ach, mein Gott!  It is good angels come to us!"" said the poor woman,",Little Women
514,crying for joy.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Funny angels in hoods and mittens,"" said Jo, and set them to laughing.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work,Little Women
514,"there.  Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the",Little Women
514,broken panes with old hats and her own cloak.  Mrs. March gave the,Little Women
514,"mother tea and gruel, and comforted her with promises of help, while",Little Women
514,she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own.  The,Little Women
514,"girls meantime spread the table, set the children round the fire, and",Little Women
514,"fed them like so many hungry birds, laughing, talking, and trying to",Little Women
514,understand the funny broken English.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Das ist gut!""  ""Die Engel-kinder!"" cried the poor things as they ate",Little Women
514,and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze. The girls had,Little Women
514,"never been called angel children before, and thought it very agreeable,",Little Women
514,"especially Jo, who had been considered a 'Sancho' ever since she was",Little Women
514,"born.  That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn't get any of",Little Women
514,"it.  And when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think there",Little Women
514,were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little,Little Women
514,girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with,Little Women
514,bread and milk on Christmas morning.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That's loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it,"" said",Little Women
514,"Meg, as they set out their presents while their mother was upstairs",Little Women
514,collecting clothes for the poor Hummels.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Not a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in",Little Women
514,"the few little bundles, and the tall vase of red roses, white",Little Women
514,"chrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave",Little Women
514,quite an elegant air to the table.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""She's coming!  Strike up, Beth!  Open the door, Amy!  Three cheers for",Little Women
514,"Marmee!"" cried Jo, prancing about while Meg went to conduct Mother to",Little Women
514,the seat of honor.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Beth played her gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg enacted",Little Women
514,"escort with great dignity.  Mrs. March was both surprised and touched,",Little Women
514,and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents and read the,Little Women
514,"little notes which accompanied them.  The slippers went on at once, a",Little Women
514,"new handkerchief was slipped into her pocket, well scented with Amy's",Little Women
514,"cologne, the rose was fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were",Little Women
514,pronounced a perfect fit.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in the",Little Women
514,"simple, loving fashion which makes these home festivals so pleasant at",Little Women
514,"the time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all fell to",Little Women
514,work.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,The morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of,Little Women
514,the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities.  Being,Little Women
514,"still too young to go often to the theater, and not rich enough to",Little Women
514,"afford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their",Little Women
514,"wits to work, and necessity being the mother of invention, made",Little Women
514,"whatever they needed.  Very clever were some of their productions,",Little Women
514,"pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned butter boats",Little Women
514,"covered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton, glittering",Little Women
514,"with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered with the",Little Women
514,same useful diamond shaped bits left in sheets when the lids of,Little Women
514,preserve pots were cut out.  The big chamber was the scene of many,Little Women
514,innocent revels.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"No gentleman were admitted, so Jo played male parts to her heart's",Little Women
514,content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet leather boots,Little Women
514,"given her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor.  These boots,",Little Women
514,"an old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some",Little Women
514,"picture, were Jo's chief treasures and appeared on all occasions.  The",Little Women
514,smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors,Little Women
514,"to take several parts apiece, and they certainly deserved some credit",Little Women
514,"for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts,",Little Women
514,"whisking in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage",Little Women
514,"besides.  It was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless",Little Women
514,"amusement, and employed many hours which otherwise would have been",Little Women
514,"idle, lonely, or spent in less profitable society.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"On Christmas night, a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was the",Little Women
514,"dress circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a",Little Women
514,most flattering state of expectancy.  There was a good deal of rustling,Little Women
514,"and whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp smoke, and an",Little Women
514,"occasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get hysterical in the",Little Women
514,"excitement of the moment.  Presently a bell sounded, the curtains flew",Little Women
514,"apart, and the _operatic tragedy_ began.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""A gloomy wood,"" according to the one playbill, was represented by a",Little Women
514,"few shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in the",Little Women
514,"distance.  This cave was made with a clothes horse for a roof, bureaus",Little Women
514,"for walls, and in it was a small furnace in full blast, with a black",Little Women
514,pot on it and an old witch bending over it.  The stage was dark and the,Little Women
514,"glow of the furnace had a fine effect, especially as real steam issued",Little Women
514,from the kettle when the witch took off the cover.  A moment was,Little Women
514,"allowed for the first thrill to subside, then Hugo, the villain,",Little Women
514,"stalked in with a clanking sword at his side, a slouching hat, black",Little Women
514,"beard, mysterious cloak, and the boots.  After pacing to and fro in",Little Women
514,"much agitation, he struck his forehead, and burst out in a wild strain,",Little Women
514,"singing of his hatred for Roderigo, his love for Zara, and his pleasing",Little Women
514,resolution to kill the one and win the other. The gruff tones of Hugo's,Little Women
514,"voice, with an occasional shout when his feelings overcame him, were",Little Women
514,"very impressive, and the audience applauded the moment he paused for",Little Women
514,"breath.  Bowing with the air of one accustomed to public praise, he",Little Women
514,"stole to the cavern and ordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding,",Little Women
514,"""What ho, minion! I need thee!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Out came Meg, with gray horsehair hanging about her face, a red and",Little Women
514,"black robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak.  Hugo",Little Women
514,"demanded a potion to make Zara adore him, and one to destroy Roderigo.",Little Women
514,"Hagar, in a fine dramatic melody, promised both, and proceeded to call",Little Women
514,up the spirit who would bring the love philter.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"    Hither, hither, from thy home,",Little Women
514,"    Airy sprite, I bid thee come!",Little Women
514,"    Born of roses, fed on dew,",Little Women
514,    Charms and potions canst thou brew?,Little Women
514,"    Bring me here, with elfin speed,",Little Women
514,    The fragrant philter which I need.,Little Women
514,"    Make it sweet and swift and strong,",Little Women
514,"    Spirit, answer now my song!",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"A soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave",Little Women
514,"appeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering wings, golden",Little Women
514,"hair, and a garland of roses on its head.  Waving a wand, it sang...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"    Hither I come,",Little Women
514,"    From my airy home,",Little Women
514,    Afar in the silver moon.,Little Women
514,"    Take the magic spell,",Little Women
514,"    And use it well,",Little Women
514,    Or its power will vanish soon!,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"And dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch's feet, the spirit",Little Women
514,"vanished.  Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition, not a",Little Women
514,"lovely one, for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and, having",Little Women
514,"croaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo and disappeared with a",Little Women
514,mocking laugh.  Having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his,Little Women
514,"boots, Hugo departed, and Hagar informed the audience that as he had",Little Women
514,"killed a few of her friends in times past, she had cursed him, and",Little Women
514,"intends to thwart his plans, and be revenged on him.  Then the curtain",Little Women
514,"fell, and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the",Little Women
514,merits of the play.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"A good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again, but",Little Women
514,when it became evident what a masterpiece of stage carpentery had been,Little Women
514,"got up, no one murmured at the delay.  It was truly superb. A tower",Little Women
514,"rose to the ceiling, halfway up appeared a window with a lamp burning",Little Women
514,"in it, and behind the white curtain appeared Zara in a lovely blue and",Little Women
514,"silver dress, waiting for Roderigo.  He came in gorgeous array, with",Little Women
514,"plumed cap, red cloak, chestnut lovelocks, a guitar, and the boots, of",Little Women
514,"course.  Kneeling at the foot of the tower, he sang a serenade in",Little Women
514,"melting tones.  Zara replied and, after a musical dialogue, consented",Little Women
514,to fly.  Then came the grand effect of the play.  Roderigo produced a,Little Women
514,"rope ladder, with five steps to it, threw up one end, and invited Zara",Little Women
514,"to descend.  Timidly she crept from her lattice, put her hand on",Little Women
514,"Roderigo's shoulder, and was about to leap gracefully down when ""Alas!",Little Women
514,"Alas for Zara!"" she forgot her train.  It caught in the window, the",Little Women
514,"tower tottered, leaned forward, fell with a crash, and buried the",Little Women
514,unhappy lovers in the ruins.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,A universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the,Little Women
514,"wreck and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, ""I told you so!  I told",Little Women
514,"you so!""  With wonderful presence of mind, Don Pedro, the cruel sire,",Little Women
514,"rushed in, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty aside...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't laugh!  Act as if it was all right!"" and, ordering Roderigo up,",Little Women
514,banished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn. Though decidedly,Little Women
514,"shaken by the fall from the tower upon him, Roderigo defied the old",Little Women
514,gentleman and refused to stir.  This dauntless example fired Zara.  She,Little Women
514,"also defied her sire, and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons",Little Women
514,of the castle.  A stout little retainer came in with chains and led,Little Women
514,"them away, looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the",Little Women
514,speech he ought to have made.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Act third was the castle hall, and here Hagar appeared, having come to",Little Women
514,"free the lovers and finish Hugo.  She hears him coming and hides, sees",Little Women
514,him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the timid little,Little Women
514,"servant, ""Bear them to the captives in their cells, and tell them I",Little Women
514,"shall come anon.""  The servant takes Hugo aside to tell him something,",Little Women
514,and Hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless.,Little Women
514,"Ferdinando, the 'minion', carries them away, and Hagar puts back the",Little Women
514,"cup which holds the poison meant for Roderigo. Hugo, getting thirsty",Little Women
514,"after a long warble, drinks it, loses his wits, and after a good deal",Little Women
514,"of clutching and stamping, falls flat and dies, while Hagar informs him",Little Women
514,what she has done in a song of exquisite power and melody.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"This was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might have",Little Women
514,thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red hair,Little Women
514,rather marred the effect of the villain's death.  He was called before,Little Women
514,"the curtain, and with great propriety appeared, leading Hagar, whose",Little Women
514,singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the,Little Women
514,performance put together.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Act fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of stabbing,Little Women
514,himself because he has been told that Zara has deserted him. Just as,Little Women
514,"the dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is sung under his window,",Little Women
514,"informing him that Zara is true but in danger, and he can save her if",Little Women
514,"he will.  A key is thrown in, which unlocks the door, and in a spasm of",Little Women
514,rapture he tears off his chains and rushes away to find and rescue his,Little Women
514,lady love.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Act fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro. He,Little Women
514,"wishes her to go into a convent, but she won't hear of it, and after a",Little Women
514,"touching appeal, is about to faint when Roderigo dashes in and demands",Little Women
514,"her hand.  Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich. They shout and",Little Women
514,"gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree, and Rodrigo is about to bear",Little Women
514,"away the exhausted Zara, when the timid servant enters with a letter",Little Women
514,"and a bag from Hagar, who has mysteriously disappeared.  The latter",Little Women
514,informs the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young pair,Little Women
514,"and an awful doom to Don Pedro, if he doesn't make them happy.  The bag",Little Women
514,"is opened, and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage",Little Women
514,till it is quite glorified with the glitter.  This entirely softens the,Little Women
514,"stern sire.  He consents without a murmur, all join in a joyful chorus,",Little Women
514,and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro's,Little Women
514,blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check, for the",Little Women
514,"cot bed, on which the dress circle was built, suddenly shut up and",Little Women
514,extinguished the enthusiastic audience.  Roderigo and Don Pedro flew to,Little Women
514,"the rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many were speechless",Little Women
514,with laughter.  The excitement had hardly subsided when Hannah,Little Women
514,"appeared, with ""Mrs. March's compliments, and would the ladies walk",Little Women
514,"down to supper.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"This was a surprise even to the actors, and when they saw the table,",Little Women
514,they looked at one another in rapturous amazement.  It was like Marmee,Little Women
514,"to get up a little treat for them, but anything so fine as this was",Little Women
514,"unheard of since the departed days of plenty.  There was ice cream,",Little Women
514,"actually two dishes of it, pink and white, and cake and fruit and",Little Women
514,"distracting French bonbons and, in the middle of the table, four great",Little Women
514,bouquets of hot house flowers.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It quite took their breath away, and they stared first at the table and",Little Women
514,"then at their mother, who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely.",Little Women

514,allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending,Little Women

514,"and makes him study very hard.  We invited him to our party, but he",Little Women

514,back out as speedily as she had bounced in.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"But the boy laughed and said pleasantly, though he looked a little",Little Women
514,"startled, ""Don't mind me, stay if you like.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Shan't I disturb you?""",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Next door.""  And he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo's prim",Little Women
514,manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about,Little Women
514,cricket when he brought the cat home.,Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,"""I thrashed 'em.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I can't thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it.""  And",Little Women
514,Jo resigned herself with a sigh.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't you like to dance, Miss Jo?"" asked Laurie, looking as if he",Little Women
514,thought the name suited her.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and everyone is",Little Women
514,"lively.  In a place like this I'm sure to upset something, tread on",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Sometimes.  You see I've been abroad a good many years, and haven't",Little Women

514,,Little Women

514,"where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake,",Little Women
514,and for holiday fun went on walking trips about Switzerland with their,Little Women

514,"off, for Jo's gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and",Little Women
514,"Jo was her merry self again, because her dress was forgotten and nobody",Little Women
514,lifted their eyebrows at her.  She liked the 'Laurence boy' better than,Little Women
514,"ever and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him",Little Women
514,"to the girls, for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys",Little Women
514,were almost unknown creatures to them.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Curly black hair, brown skin, big black eyes, handsome nose, fine",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"It was on the tip of Jo's tongue to ask, but she checked herself in",Little Women

514,'pegging' which had escaped her.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie smiled but didn't seem shocked, and answered with a shrug.  ""Not",Little Women
514,"for a year or two.  I won't go before seventeen, anyway.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Aren't you but fifteen?"" asked Jo, looking at the tall lad, whom she",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I burn my",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"But Laurie didn't laugh.  He only looked down a minute, and the",Little Women
514,"expression of his face puzzled Jo when he said very gently, ""Never mind",Little Women
514,"that.  I'll tell you how we can manage.  There's a long hall out there,",Little Women
514,"and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us. Please come.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo thanked him and gladly went, wishing she had two neat gloves when",Little Women
514,"she saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her partner wore.  The hall was",Little Women
514,"empty, and they had a grand polka, for Laurie danced well, and taught",Little Women
514,"her the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of swing and",Little Women
514,"spring.  When the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to get",Little Women
514,"their breath, and Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students'",Little Women
514,festival at Heidelberg when Meg appeared in search of her sister.  She,Little Women
514,"beckoned, and Jo reluctantly followed her into a side room, where she",Little Women
514,"found her on a sofa, holding her foot, and looking pale.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I've sprained my ankle.  That stupid high heel turned and gave me a",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""I knew you'd hurt your feet with those silly shoes.  I'm sorry.  But I",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""I can't have a carriage without its costing ever so much.  I dare say",Little Women
514,"I can't get one at all, for most people come in their own, and it's a",Little Women
514,"long way to the stable, and no one to send.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll go.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, indeed!  It's past nine, and dark as Egypt.  I can't stop here,",Little Women
514,for the house is full.  Sallie has some girls staying with her. I'll,Little Women
514,"rest till Hannah comes, and then do the best I can.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll ask Laurie.  He will go,"" said Jo, looking relieved as the idea",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Mercy, no!  Don't ask or tell anyone.  Get me my rubbers, and put",Little Women
514,"these slippers with our things.  I can't dance anymore, but as soon as",Little Women
514,"supper is over, watch for Hannah and tell me the minute she comes.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""They are going out to supper now.  I'll stay with you.  I'd rather.""",Little Women

514,"""No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee.  I'm so tired I can't",Little Women
514,"stir.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"So Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went blundering away",Little Women
514,"to the dining room, which she found after going into a china closet,",Little Women
514,and opening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a,Little Women
514,"little private refreshment.  Making a dart at the table, she secured",Little Women
514,"the coffee, which she immediately spilled, thereby making the front of",Little Women
514,her dress as bad as the back.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!"" exclaimed Jo, finishing Meg's",Little Women

514,"""Too bad!   I was looking for someone to give this to.  May I take it",Little Women

514,"myself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo led the way, and as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie drew up a",Little Women
514,"little table, brought a second installment of coffee and ice for Jo,",Little Women
514,and was so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him a 'nice,Little Women
514,"boy'.  They had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes, and were in",Little Women
514,"the midst of a quiet game of _Buzz_, with two or three other young",Little Women
514,"people who had strayed in, when Hannah appeared.  Meg forgot her foot",Little Women
514,"and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo, with an",Little Women
514,exclamation of pain.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Hush!  Don't say anything,"" she whispered, adding aloud, ""It's",Little Women
514,"nothing.  I turned my foot a little, that's all,"" and limped upstairs",Little Women
514,to put her things on.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Hannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her wits' end, till she",Little Women
514,"decided to take things into her own hands.  Slipping out, she ran down",Little Women
514,"and, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage. It",Little Women
514,happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood,Little Women
514,"and Jo was looking round for help when Laurie, who had heard what she",Little Women
514,"said, came up and offered his grandfather's carriage, which had just",Little Women
514,"come for him, he said.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's so early!  You can't mean to go yet?"" began Jo, looking relieved",Little Women
514,but hesitating to accept the offer.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I always go early, I do, truly!  Please let me take you home. It's all",Little Women
514,"on my way, you know, and it rains, they say.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"That settled it, and telling him of Meg's mishap, Jo gratefully",Little Women
514,accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party.  Hannah,Little Women
514,"hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble, and they",Little Women
514,"rolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive and",Little Women
514,"elegant.  Laurie went on the box so Meg could keep her foot up, and the",Little Women
514,girls talked over their party in freedom.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I had a capital time.  Did you?"" asked Jo, rumpling up her hair, and",Little Women
514,making herself comfortable.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, till I hurt myself.  Sallie's friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy",Little Women

514,"envious or discontented, but it was very natural that the young girl",Little Women
514,"should long for pretty things, gay friends, accomplishments, and a",Little Women
514,"happy life.  At the Kings' she daily saw all she wanted, for the",Little Women

514,and saw money lavished on trifles which would have been so precious to,Little Women
514,"her.  Poor Meg seldom complained, but a sense of injustice made her",Little Women

514,"longer, but Aunt March always cleared up quickly, and sent for her to",Little Women

514,"I suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books,",Little Women

514,"down from the tall bookcases, the cozy chairs, the globes, and best of",Little Women

514,"Beth was too bashful to go to school.  It had been tried, but she",Little Women

514,"devote her skill and energy to Soldiers' Aid Societies, Beth went",Little Women
514,faithfully on by herself and did the best she could.  She was a,Little Women

514,"comfortable for the workers, never thinking of any reward but to be",Little Women
514,"loved.  Long, quiet days she spent, not lonely nor idle, for her little",Little Women
514,"world was peopled with imaginary friends, and she was by nature a busy",Little Women
514,"bee.  There were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning,",Little Women
514,for Beth was a child still and loved her pets as well as ever.  Not one,Little Women
514,"whole or handsome one among them, all were outcasts till Beth took them",Little Women
514,"in, for when her sisters outgrew these idols, they passed to her",Little Women
514,because Amy would have nothing old or ugly. Beth cherished them all the,Little Women
514,"more tenderly for that very reason, and set up a hospital for infirm",Little Women
514,"dolls.  No pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals, no harsh",Little Women
514,"words or blows were ever given them, no neglect ever saddened the heart",Little Women
514,"of the most repulsive, but all were fed and clothed, nursed and",Little Women
514,caressed with an affection which never failed. One forlorn fragment of,Little Women
514,"dollanity had belonged to Jo and, having led a tempestuous life, was",Little Women
514,"left a wreck in the rag bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued",Little Women
514,"by Beth and taken to her refuge.  Having no top to its head, she tied",Little Women
514,"on a neat little cap, and as both arms and legs were gone, she hid",Little Women
514,these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed,Little Women
514,to this chronic invalid.  If anyone had known the care lavished on that,Little Women
514,"dolly, I think it would have touched their hearts, even while they",Little Women
514,"laughed. She brought it bits of bouquets, she read to it, took it out",Little Women
514,"to breathe fresh air, hidden under her coat, she sang it lullabies and",Little Women

514,"""Now, Marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories",Little Women

514,"""I like that kind of sermon.  It's the sort Father used to tell us,""",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""I don't complain near as much as the others do, and I shall be more",Little Women
514,"careful than ever now, for I've had warning from Susie's downfall,""",Little Women
514,said Amy morally.,Little Women

514,"""We needed that lesson, and we won't forget it.  If we do so, you just",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""What in the world are you going to do now, Jo?"" asked Meg one snowy",Little Women
514,"afternoon, as her sister came tramping through the hall, in rubber",Little Women
514,"boots, old sack, and hood, with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the",Little Women
514,other.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Going out for exercise,"" answered Jo with a mischievous twinkle in her",Little Women
514,eyes.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I should think two long walks this morning would have been enough!",Little Women
514,"It's cold and dull out, and I advise you to stay warm and dry by the",Little Women
514,"fire, as I do,"" said Meg with a shiver.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Never take advice!  Can't keep still all day, and not being a",Little Women
514,"pussycat, I don't like to doze by the fire.  I like adventures, and I'm",Little Women
514,"going to find some.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg went back to toast her feet and read _Ivanhoe_, and Jo began to dig",Little Women
514,"paths with great energy.  The snow was light, and with her broom she",Little Women
514,"soon swept a path all round the garden, for Beth to walk in when the",Little Women
514,"sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air.  Now, the garden",Little Women
514,separated the Marches' house from that of Mr. Laurence.  Both stood in,Little Women
514,"a suburb of the city, which was still country-like, with groves and",Little Women
514,"lawns, large gardens, and quiet streets.  A low hedge parted the two",Little Women
514,"estates.  On one side was an old, brown house, looking rather bare and",Little Women
514,"shabby, robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the",Little Women
514,"flowers, which then surrounded it.  On the other side was a stately",Little Women
514,"stone mansion, plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury,",Little Women
514,from the big coach house and well-kept grounds to the conservatory and,Little Women
514,the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Yet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of house, for no children",Little Women
514,"frolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled at the windows, and",Little Women
514,"few people went in and out, except the old gentleman and his grandson.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"To Jo's lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted",Little Women
514,"palace, full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed.  She had",Little Women
514,"long wanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the Laurence",Little Women
514,"boy, who looked as if he would like to be known, if he only knew how to",Little Women
514,"begin.  Since the party, she had been more eager than ever, and had",Little Women
514,"planned many ways of making friends with him, but he had not been seen",Little Women
514,"lately, and Jo began to think he had gone away, when she one day spied",Little Women
514,"a brown face at an upper window, looking wistfully down into their",Little Women
514,"garden, where Beth and Amy were snow-balling one another.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That boy is suffering for society and fun,"" she said to herself. ""His",Little Women
514,"grandpa does not know what's good for him, and keeps him shut up all",Little Women
514,"alone.  He needs a party of jolly boys to play with, or somebody young",Little Women
514,and lively.  I've a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman,Little Women
514,"so!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The idea amused Jo, who liked to do daring things and was always",Little Women
514,scandalizing Meg by her queer performances.  The plan of 'going over',Little Women
514,"was not forgotten.  And when the snowy afternoon came, Jo resolved to",Little Women
514,"try what could be done.  She saw Mr. Lawrence drive off, and then",Little Women
514,"sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge, where she paused and took",Little Women
514,"a survey.  All quiet, curtains down at the lower windows, servants out",Little Women
514,"of sight, and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a",Little Women
514,thin hand at the upper window.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""There he is,"" thought Jo, ""Poor boy!  All alone and sick this dismal",Little Women
514,"day.  It's a shame!  I'll toss up a snowball and make him look out, and",Little Women
514,"then say a kind word to him.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Up went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once, showing a",Little Women
514,"face which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big eyes",Little Women
514,"brightened and the mouth began to smile.  Jo nodded and laughed, and",Little Women
514,flourished her broom as she called out...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How do you do?  Are you sick?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Better, thank you.  I've had a bad cold, and been shut up a week.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm sorry.  What do you amuse yourself with?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Nothing.  It's dull as tombs up here.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't you read?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not much.  They won't let me.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Can't somebody read to you?""",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Have someone come and see you then.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""There isn't anyone I'd like to see.  Boys make such a row, and my head",Little Women
514,"is weak.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Isn't there some nice girl who'd read and amuse you?  Girls are quiet",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't know any.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You know us,"" began Jo, then laughed and stopped.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""So I do!  Will you come, please?"" cried Laurie.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm not quiet and nice, but I'll come, if Mother will let me. I'll go",Little Women
514,"ask her.  Shut the window, like a good boy, and wait till I come.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"With that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house,",Little Women
514,wondering what they would all say to her.  Laurie was in a flutter of,Little Women
514,"excitement at the idea of having company, and flew about to get ready,",Little Women
514,"for as Mrs. March said, he was 'a little gentleman', and did honor to",Little Women
514,"the coming guest by brushing his curly pate, putting on a fresh collar,",Little Women
514,"and trying to tidy up the room, which in spite of half a dozen",Little Women
514,"servants, was anything but neat.  Presently there came a loud ring,",Little Women
514,"than a decided voice, asking for 'Mr. Laurie', and a surprised-looking",Little Women
514,servant came running up to announce a young lady.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""All right, show her up, it's Miss Jo,"" said Laurie, going to the door",Little Women
514,"of his little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, looking rosy and quite",Little Women
514,"at her ease, with a covered dish in one hand and Beth's three kittens",Little Women
514,in the other.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Here I am, bag and baggage,"" she said briskly.  ""Mother sent her love,",Little Women
514,and was glad if I could do anything for you.  Meg wanted me to bring,Little Women
514,"some of her blanc mange, she makes it very nicely, and Beth thought her",Little Women
514,"cats would be comforting.  I knew you'd laugh at them, but I couldn't",Little Women
514,"refuse, she was so anxious to do something.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It so happened that Beth's funny loan was just the thing, for in",Little Women
514,"laughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew",Little Women
514,sociable at once.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That looks too pretty to eat,"" he said, smiling with pleasure, as Jo",Little Women
514,"uncovered the dish, and showed the blanc mange, surrounded by a garland",Little Women
514,"of green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy's pet geranium.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It isn't anything, only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it.",Little Women
514,Tell the girl to put it away for your tea.  It's so simple you can eat,Little Women
514,"it, and being soft, it will slip down without hurting your sore throat.",Little Women
514,"What a cozy room this is!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It might be if it was kept nice, but the maids are lazy, and I don't",Little Women
514,"know how to make them mind.  It worries me though.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll right it up in two minutes, for it only needs to have the hearth",Little Women
514,"brushed, so--and the things made straight on the mantelpiece, so--and",Little Women
514,"the books put here, and the bottles there, and your sofa turned from",Little Women
514,"the light, and the pillows plumped up a bit.  Now then, you're fixed.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"And so he was, for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked things",Little Women
514,into place and given quite a different air to the room.  Laurie watched,Little Women
514,"her in respectful silence, and when she beckoned him to his sofa, he",Little Women
514,"sat down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How kind you are!  Yes, that's what it wanted.  Now please take the",Little Women
514,"big chair and let me do something to amuse my company.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, I came to amuse you.  Shall I read aloud?"" and Jo looked",Little Women
514,affectionately toward some inviting books near by.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Thank you!  I've read all those, and if you don't mind, I'd rather",Little Women
514,"talk,"" answered Laurie.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not a bit.  I'll talk all day if you'll only set me going. Beth says I",Little Women
514,"never know when to stop.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home good deal and sometimes goes",Little Women
514,"out with a little basket?"" asked Laurie with interest.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, that's Beth.  She's my girl, and a regular good one she is, too.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""The pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I believe?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How did you find that out?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie colored up, but answered frankly, ""Why, you see I often hear you",Little Women
514,"calling to one another, and when I'm alone up here, I can't help",Little Women
514,"looking over at your house, you always seem to be having such good",Little Women
514,"times.  I beg your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you forget",Little Women
514,to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are. And when,Little Women
514,"the lamps are lighted, it's like looking at a picture to see the fire,",Little Women
514,and you all around the table with your mother.  Her face is right,Little Women
514,"opposite, and it looks so sweet behind the flowers, I can't help",Little Women
514,"watching it.  I haven't got any mother, you know."" And Laurie poked the",Little Women
514,fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo's warm heart.",Little Women
514,"She had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head,",Little Women
514,and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child.  Laurie was,Little Women
514,"sick and lonely, and feeling how rich she was in home and happiness,",Little Women
514,she gladly tried to share it with him. Her face was very friendly and,Little Women
514,her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""We'll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to look",Little Women
514,"as much as you like.  I just wish, though, instead of peeping, you'd",Little Women
514,"come over and see us.  Mother is so splendid, she'd do you heaps of",Little Women
514,"good, and Beth would sing to you if I begged her to, and Amy would",Little Women
514,"dance.  Meg and I would make you laugh over our funny stage properties,",Little Women
514,"and we'd have jolly times.  Wouldn't your grandpa let you?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I think he would, if your mother asked him.  He's very kind, though he",Little Women
514,"does not look so, and he lets me do what I like, pretty much, only he's",Little Women
514,"afraid I might be a bother to strangers,"" began Laurie, brightening",Little Women
514,more and more.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn't think you'd be",Little Women
514,"a bother.  We want to know you, and I've been trying to do it this ever",Little Women
514,"so long.  We haven't been here a great while, you know, but we have got",Little Women
514,"acquainted with all our neighbors but you.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You see, Grandpa lives among his books, and doesn't mind much what",Little Women
514,"happens outside.  Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn't stay here, you know,",Little Women
514,"and I have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home and get",Little Women
514,"on as I can.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That's bad.  You ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere",Little Women
514,"you are asked, then you'll have plenty of friends, and pleasant places",Little Women
514,to go to.  Never mind being bashful.  It won't last long if you keep,Little Women
514,"going.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie turned red again, but wasn't offended at being accused of",Little Women
514,"bashfulness, for there was so much good will in Jo it was impossible",Little Women
514,not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Do you like your school?"" asked the boy, changing the subject, after a",Little Women
514,"little pause, during which he stared at the fire and Jo looked about",Little Women
514,"her, well pleased.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't go to school, I'm a businessman--girl, I mean.  I go to wait on",Little Women
514,"my great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too,"" answered Jo.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie opened his mouth to ask another question, but remembering just",Little Women
514,in time that it wasn't manners to make too many inquiries into people's,Little Women
514,"affairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo liked his good breeding, and didn't mind having a laugh at Aunt",Little Women
514,"March, so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old lady,",Little Women
514,"her fat poodle, the parrot that talked Spanish, and the library where",Little Women
514,she reveled.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie enjoyed that immensely, and when she told about the prim old",Little Women
514,"gentleman who came once to woo Aunt March, and in the middle of a fine",Little Women
514,"speech, how Poll had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay, the boy",Little Women
514,"lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and a maid",Little Women
514,popped her head in to see what was the matter.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh!  That does me no end of good.  Tell on, please,"" he said, taking",Little Women
514,"his face out of the sofa cushion, red and shining with merriment.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Much elated with her success, Jo did 'tell on', all about their plays",Little Women
514,"and plans, their hopes and fears for Father, and the most interesting",Little Women
514,events of the little world in which the sisters lived.  Then they got,Little Women
514,"to talking about books, and to Jo's delight, she found that Laurie",Little Women
514,"loved them as well as she did, and had read even more than herself.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""If you like them so much, come down and see ours.  Grandfather is out,",Little Women
514,"so you needn't be afraid,"" said Laurie, getting up.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm not afraid of anything,"" returned Jo, with a toss of the head.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I don't believe you are!"" exclaimed the boy, looking at her with much",Little Women
514,"admiration, though he privately thought she would have good reason to",Little Women
514,"be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she met him in some of his",Little Women
514,moods.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike, Laurie led the way",Little Women
514,"from room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever struck her",Little Women
514,"fancy.  And so, at last they came to the library, where she clapped her",Little Women
514,"hands and pranced, as she always did when especially delighted.  It was",Little Women
514,"lined with books, and there were pictures and statues, and distracting",Little Women
514,"little cabinets full of coins and curiosities, and Sleepy Hollow",Little Women
514,"chairs, and queer tables, and bronzes, and best of all, a great open",Little Women
514,fireplace with quaint tiles all round it.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What richness!"" sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velour chair",Little Women
514,"and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction. ""Theodore",Little Women
514,"Laurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world,"" she added",Little Women
514,impressively.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""A fellow can't live on books,"" said Laurie, shaking his head as he",Little Women
514,perched on a table opposite.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Before he could more, a bell rang, and Jo flew up, exclaiming with",Little Women
514,"alarm, ""Mercy me!  It's your grandpa!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, what if it is?  You are not afraid of anything, you know,""",Little Women
514,"returned the boy, looking wicked.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don't know why I should",Little Women

514,"afraid you are very tired of talking to me.  It was so pleasant, I",Little Women
514,"couldn't bear to stop,"" said Laurie gratefully.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""The doctor to see you, sir,"" and the maid beckoned as she spoke.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Would you mind if I left you for a minute?  I suppose I must see him,""",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't mind me.  I'm happy as a cricket here,"" answered Jo.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way. She was",Little Women
514,standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when the door,Little Women
514,"opened again, and without turning, she said decidedly, ""I'm sure now",Little Women
514,"that I shouldn't be afraid of him, for he's got kind eyes, though his",Little Women
514,"mouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own.",Little Women
514,"He isn't as handsome as my grandfather, but I like him.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Thank you, ma'am,"" said a gruff voice behind her, and there, to her",Little Women
514,"great dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Poor Jo blushed till she couldn't blush any redder, and her heart began",Little Women
514,to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said.  For a,Little Women
514,"minute a wild desire to run away possessed her, but that was cowardly,",Little Women
514,"and the girls would laugh at her, so she resolved to stay and get out",Little Women
514,of the scrape as she could.  A second look showed her that the living,Little Women
514,"eyes, under the bushy eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted ones,",Little Women
514,"and there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a good",Little Women
514,"deal.  The gruff voice was gruffer than ever, as the old gentleman said",Little Women
514,"abruptly, after the dreadful pause, ""So you're not afraid of me, hey?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not much, sir.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,"""And I've got a tremendous will, have I?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I only said I thought so.""",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, I do, sir.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"That answer pleased the old gentleman.  He gave a short laugh, shook",Little Women
514,"hands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin, turned up her",Little Women
514,"face, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying with a nod, ""You've",Little Women
514,"got your grandfather's spirit, if you haven't his face.  He was a fine",Little Women
514,"man, my dear, but what is better, he was a brave and an honest one, and",Little Women
514,"I was proud to be his friend.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Shouldn't ask you, if I didn't.""  And Mr. Laurence offered her his arm",Little Women
514,with old-fashioned courtesy.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What would Meg say to this?"" thought Jo, as she was marched away,",Little Women
514,while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the,Little Women
514,story at home.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Hey!  Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?"" said the old",Little Women
514,"gentleman, as Laurie came running downstairs and brought up with a",Little Women
514,start of surprise at the astounding sight of Jo arm in arm with his,Little Women
514,redoubtable grandfather.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I didn't know you'd come, sir,"" he began, as Jo gave him a triumphant",Little Women
514,little glance.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That's evident, by the way you racket downstairs.  Come to your tea,",Little Women
514,"sir, and behave like a gentleman.""  And having pulled the boy's hair by",Little Women
514,"way of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while Laurie went through a",Little Women
514,"series of comic evolutions behind their backs, which nearly produced an",Little Women
514,explosion of laughter from Jo.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea,",Little Women
514,"but he watched the young people, who soon chatted away like old",Little Women
514,"friends, and the change in his grandson did not escape him.  There was",Little Women
514,"color, light, and life in the boy's face now, vivacity in his manner,",Little Women
514,and genuine merriment in his laugh.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""She's right, the lad is lonely.  I'll see what these little girls can",Little Women
514,"do for him,"" thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and listened.  He liked",Little Women
514,"Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him, and she seemed to understand",Little Women
514,the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"If the Laurences had been what Jo called 'prim and poky', she would not",Little Women
514,"have got on at all, for such people always made her shy and awkward.",Little Women
514,"But finding them free and easy, she was so herself, and made a good",Little Women
514,"impression.  When they rose she proposed to go, but Laurie said he had",Little Women
514,"something more to show her, and took her away to the conservatory,",Little Women
514,which had been lighted for her benefit.  It seemed quite fairylike to,Little Women
514,"Jo, as she went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on",Little Women
514,"either side, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful",Little Women
514,"vines and trees that hung about her, while her new friend cut the",Little Women
514,"finest flowers till his hands were full.  Then he tied them up, saying,",Little Women
514,"with the happy look Jo liked to see, ""Please give these to your mother,",Little Women
514,"and tell her I like the medicine she sent me very much.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,They found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing,Little Women
514,"room, but Jo's attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano, which",Little Women
514,stood open.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Do you play?"" she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful",Little Women
514,expression.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Sometimes,"" he answered modestly.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Please do now.  I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Won't you first?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't know how.  Too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"So Laurie played and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously buried in",Little Women
514,heliotrope and tea roses.  Her respect and regard for the 'Laurence',Little Women
514,"boy increased very much, for he played remarkably well and didn't put",Little Women
514,"on any airs.  She wished Beth could hear him, but she did not say so,",Little Women
514,"only praised him till he was quite abashed, and his grandfather came to",Little Women
514,his rescue.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That will do, that will do, young lady.  Too many sugarplums are not",Little Women
514,"good for him.  His music isn't bad, but I hope he will do as well in",Little Women
514,"more important things.  Going?  well, I'm much obliged to you, and I",Little Women
514,"hope you'll come again.  My respects to your mother. Good night, Doctor",Little Women
514,"Jo.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not please him.",Little Women
514,"When they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she had said something",Little Women
514,amiss.  He shook his head.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, it was me.  He doesn't like to hear me play.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Why not?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll tell you some day.  John is going home with you, as I can't.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No need of that.  I am not a young lady, and it's only a step.  Take",Little Women
514,"care of yourself, won't you?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, but you will come again, I hope?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""If you promise to come and see us after you are well.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I will.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Good night, Laurie!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Good night, Jo, good night!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"When all the afternoon's adventures had been told, the family felt",Little Women
514,"inclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something very",Little Women
514,attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge. Mrs. March,Little Women
514,wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten,Little Women
514,"him, Meg longed to walk in the conservatory, Beth sighed for the grand",Little Women
514,"piano, and Amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Mother, why didn't Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?"" asked Jo,",Little Women
514,who was of an inquiring disposition.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie's father,",Little Women
514,"married an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the old man, who",Little Women
514,"is very proud.  The lady was good and lovely and accomplished, but he",Little Women
514,"did not like her, and never saw his son after he married.  They both",Little Women
514,"died when Laurie was a little child, and then his grandfather took him",Little Women
514,"home.  I fancy the boy, who was born in Italy, is not very strong, and",Little Women
514,"the old man is afraid of losing him, which makes him so careful.",Little Women
514,"Laurie comes naturally by his love of music, for he is like his mother,",Little Women
514,and I dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician.,Little Women
514,"At any rate, his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so",Little Women
514,"he 'glowered' as Jo said.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Dear me, how romantic!"" exclaimed Meg.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How silly!"" said Jo.  ""Let him be a musician if he wants to, and not",Little Women
514,"plague his life out sending him to college, when he hates to go.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That's why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners, I",Little Women
514,"suppose.  Italians are always nice,"" said Meg, who was a little",Little Women
514,sentimental.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What do you know about his eyes and his manners?  You never spoke to",Little Women
514,"him, hardly,"" cried Jo, who was not sentimental.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows how to",Little Women
514,behave.  That was a nice little speech about the medicine Mother sent,Little Women
514,"him.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""He meant the blanc mange, I suppose.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How stupid you are, child!  He meant you, of course.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Did he?"" And Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her",Little Women
514,before.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I never saw such a girl!  You don't know a compliment when you get",Little Women

514,"""I think they are great nonsense, and I'll thank you not to be silly",Little Women
514,"and spoil my fun.  Laurie's a nice boy and I like him, and I won't have",Little Women
514,any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish.  We'll all be,Little Women
514,"good to him because he hasn't got any mother, and he may come over and",Little Women
514,"see us, mayn't he, Marmee?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""I was thinking about our '_Pilgrim's Progress_',"" answered Beth, who",Little Women
514,"had not heard a word.  ""How we got out of the Slough and through the",Little Women
514,"Wicket Gate by resolving to be good, and up the steep hill by trying,",Little Women
514,"and that maybe the house over there, full of splendid things, is going",Little Women
514,"to be our Palace Beautiful.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""We have got to get by the lions first,"" said Jo, as if she rather",Little Women

514,CHAPTER SIX,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,BETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some time",Little Women
514,"for all to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass the lions.  Old",Little Women
514,"Mr. Laurence was the biggest one, but after he had called, said",Little Women
514,"something funny or kind to each one of the girls, and talked over old",Little Women
514,"times with their mother, nobody felt much afraid of him, except timid",Little Women
514,"Beth.  The other lion was the fact that they were poor and Laurie rich,",Little Women
514,for this made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return.,Little Women
514,"But, after a while, they found that he considered them the benefactors,",Little Women
514,and could not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March's,Little Women
514,"motherly welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in",Little Women
514,that humble home of theirs.  So they soon forgot their pride and,Little Women
514,interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time, for the new",Little Women
514,"friendship flourished like grass in spring.  Every one liked Laurie,",Little Women
514,"and he privately informed his tutor that ""the Marches were regularly",Little Women
514,"splendid girls.""  With the delightful enthusiasm of youth, they took",Little Women
514,"the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him, and he found",Little Women
514,something very charming in the innocent companionship of these,Little Women
514,"simple-hearted girls.  Never having known mother or sisters, he was",Little Women
514,"quick to feel the influences they brought about him, and their busy,",Little Women
514,lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led. He was tired,Little Women
514,"of books, and found people so interesting now that Mr. Brooke was",Little Women
514,"obliged to make very unsatisfactory reports, for Laurie was always",Little Women
514,playing truant and running over to the Marches'.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Never mind, let him take a holiday, and make it up afterward,"" said",Little Women
514,"the old gentleman.  ""The good lady next door says he is studying too",Little Women
514,"hard and needs young society, amusement, and exercise.  I suspect she",Little Women
514,"is right, and that I've been coddling the fellow as if I'd been his",Little Women
514,"grandmother.  Let him do what he likes, as long as he is happy. He",Little Women
514,"can't get into mischief in that little nunnery over there, and Mrs.",Little Women
514,"March is doing more for him than we can.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"What good times they had, to be sure.  Such plays and tableaux, such",Little Women
514,"sleigh rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in the old",Little Women
514,"parlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the great house.",Little Women
514,Meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked and revel in,Little Women
514,"bouquets, Jo browsed over the new library voraciously, and convulsed",Little Women
514,"the old gentleman with her criticisms, Amy copied pictures and enjoyed",Little Women
514,"beauty to her heart's content, and Laurie played 'lord of the manor' in",Little Women
514,the most delightful style.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck up",Little Women
514,"courage to go to the 'Mansion of Bliss', as Meg called it.  She went",Little Women
514,"once with Jo, but the old gentleman, not being aware of her infirmity,",Little Women
514,"stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said ""Hey!"" so",Little Women
514,"loud, that he frightened her so much her 'feet chattered on the floor',",Little Women
514,"she never told her mother, and she ran away, declaring she would never",Little Women
514,"go there any more, not even for the dear piano.  No persuasions or",Little Women
514,"enticements could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr.",Little Women
514,"Laurence's ear in some mysterious way, he set about mending matters.",Little Women
514,"During one of the brief calls he made, he artfully led the conversation",Little Women
514,"to music, and talked away about great singers whom he had seen, fine",Little Women
514,"organs he had heard, and told such charming anecdotes that Beth found",Little Women
514,"it impossible to stay in her distant corner, but crept nearer and",Little Women
514,"nearer, as if fascinated.  At the back of his chair she stopped and",Little Women
514,"stood listening, with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with",Little Women
514,excitement of this unusual performance.  Taking no more notice of her,Little Women
514,"than if she had been a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie's",Little Women
514,"lessons and teachers.  And presently, as if the idea had just occurred",Little Women
514,"to him, he said to Mrs. March...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""The boy neglects his music now, and I'm glad of it, for he was getting",Little Women
514,too fond of it.  But the piano suffers for want of use.  Wouldn't some,Little Women
514,"of your girls like to run over, and practice on it now and then, just",Little Women
514,"to keep it in tune, you know, ma'am?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together to",Little Women
514,"keep from clapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation, and",Little Women
514,the thought of practicing on that splendid instrument quite took her,Little Women
514,"breath away.  Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. Laurence went on with",Little Women
514,an odd little nod and smile...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""They needn't see or speak to anyone, but run in at any time. For I'm",Little Women
514,"shut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is out a",Little Women
514,"great deal, and the servants are never near the drawing room after nine",Little Women
514,"o'clock.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, for that",Little Women
514,"last arrangement left nothing to be desired.  ""Please, tell the young",Little Women
514,"ladies what I say, and if they don't care to come, why, never mind.""",Little Women
514,"Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked up at him with a",Little Women
514,"face full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh sir, they do care, very very much!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Are you the musical girl?"" he asked, without any startling ""Hey!"" as",Little Women
514,he looked down at her very kindly.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm Beth.  I love it dearly, and I'll come, if you are quite sure",Little Women
514,"nobody will hear me, and be disturbed,"" she added, fearing to be rude,",Little Women
514,and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not a soul, my dear.  The house is empty half the day, so come and",Little Women
514,"drum away as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to you.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How kind you are, sir!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore, but she was",Little Women
514,"not frightened now, and gave the hand a grateful squeeze because she",Little Women
514,had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her. The,Little Women
514,"old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and, stooping",Little Women
514,"down, he kissed her, saying, in a tone few people ever heard...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I had a little girl once, with eyes like these.  God bless you, my",Little Women
514,"dear!  Good day, madam.""  And away he went, in a great hurry.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Beth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to impart the",Little Women
514,"glorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls were not home.",Little Women
514,"How blithely she sang that evening, and how they all laughed at her",Little Women
514,because she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in,Little Women
514,"her sleep.  Next day, having seen both the old and young gentleman out",Little Women
514,"of the house, Beth, after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the",Little Women
514,"side door, and made her way as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing",Little Women
514,"room where her idol stood.  Quite by accident, of course, some pretty,",Little Women
514,"easy music lay on the piano, and with trembling fingers and frequent",Little Women
514,"stops to listen and look about, Beth at last touched the great",Little Women
514,"instrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything",Little Women
514,"else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was",Little Women
514,like the voice of a beloved friend.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner, but she had no",Little Women
514,"appetite, and could only sit and smile upon everyone in a general state",Little Women
514,of beatitude.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"After that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly",Little Women
514,"every day, and the great drawing room was haunted by a tuneful spirit",Little Women
514,that came and went unseen.  She never knew that Mr. Laurence opened his,Little Women
514,study door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked.  She never saw,Little Women
514,Laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away. She never,Little Women
514,suspected that the exercise books and new songs which she found in the,Little Women
514,"rack were put there for her especial benefit, and when he talked to her",Little Women
514,"about music at home, she only thought how kind he was to tell things",Little Women
514,"that helped her so much.  So she enjoyed herself heartily, and found,",Little Women
514,"what isn't always the case, that her granted wish was all she had",Little Women
514,hoped.  Perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing,Little Women
514,that a greater was given her.  At any rate she deserved both.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Mother, I'm going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers.  He is so",Little Women
514,"kind to me, I must thank him, and I don't know any other way. Can I do",Little Women
514,"it?"" asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful call of his.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, dear.  It will please him very much, and be a nice way of",Little Women
514,"thanking him.  The girls will help you about them, and I will pay for",Little Women
514,"the making up,"" replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in",Little Women
514,granting Beth's requests because she so seldom asked anything for,Little Women
514,herself.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was chosen,",Little Women
514,"the materials bought, and the slippers begun.  A cluster of grave yet",Little Women
514,cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced very,Little Women
514,"appropriate and pretty, and Beth worked away early and late, with",Little Women
514,"occasional lifts over hard parts.  She was a nimble little needlewoman,",Little Women
514,and they were finished before anyone got tired of them.  Then she wrote,Little Women
514,"a short, simple note, and with Laurie's help, got them smuggled onto",Little Women
514,the study table one morning before the old gentleman was up.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"When this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would happen.",Little Women
514,All day passed and a part of the next before any acknowledgement,Little Women
514,"arrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crochety",Little Women
514,"friend.  On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an",Little Women
514,"errand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise.  As",Little Women
514,"she came up the street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four heads",Little Women
514,"popping in and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her,",Little Women
514,"several hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Here's a letter from the old gentleman!  Come quick, and read it!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, Beth, he's sent you..."" began Amy, gesticulating with unseemly",Little Women
514,"energy, but she got no further, for Jo quenched her by slamming down",Little Women
514,the window.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense.  At the door her sisters,Little Women
514,"seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession, all",Little Women
514,"pointing and all saying at once, ""Look there!  Look there!""  Beth did",Little Women
514,"look, and turned pale with delight and surprise, for there stood a",Little Women
514,"little cabinet piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed",Little Women
514,"like a sign board to ""Miss Elizabeth March.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""For me?"" gasped Beth, holding onto Jo and feeling as if she should",Little Women
514,"tumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, all for you, my precious!  Isn't it splendid of him?  Don't you",Little Women
514,think he's the dearest old man in the world?  Here's the key in the,Little Women
514,"letter.  We didn't open it, but we are dying to know what he says,""",Little Women
514,"cried Jo, hugging her sister and offering the note.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You read it!  I can't, I feel so queer!  Oh, it is too lovely!"" and",Little Women
514,"Beth hid her face in Jo's apron, quite upset by her present.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo opened the paper and began to laugh, for the first words she saw",Little Women
514,were...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Miss March: ""Dear Madam--""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How nice it sounds!  I wish someone would write to me so!"" said Amy,",Little Women

514,"called out, ""come in!"" she did go in, right up to Mr. Laurence, who",Little Women
514,"looked quite taken aback, and held out her hand, saying, with only a",Little Women
514,"small quaver in her voice, ""I came to thank you, sir, for..."" But she",Little Women
514,"didn't finish, for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech",Little Women

514,"little kiss that all his crustiness vanished, and he just set her on",Little Women
514,"his knee, and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling as",Little Women
514,if he had got his own little granddaughter back again.  Beth ceased to,Little Women
514,"fear him from that moment, and sat there talking to him as cozily as if",Little Women
514,"she had known him all her life, for love casts out fear, and gratitude",Little Women

514,"Next day Amy was rather late at school, but could not resist the",Little Women

514,During the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got,Little Women
514,twenty-four delicious limes (she ate one on the way) and was going to,Little Women
514,"treat circulated through her 'set', and the attentions of her friends",Little Women
514,became quite overwhelming.  Katy Brown invited her to her next party on,Little Women

514,"and Jenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who had basely twitted Amy upon",Little Women
514,"her limeless state, promptly buried the hatchet and offered to furnish",Little Women
514,answers to certain appalling sums.  But Amy had not forgotten Miss,Little Women
514,Snow's cutting remarks about 'some persons whose noses were not too,Little Women
514,"flat to smell other people's limes, and stuck-up people who were not",Little Women
514,"too proud to ask for them', and she instantly crushed 'that Snow",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"A distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning,",Little Women
514,"and Amy's beautifully drawn maps received praise, which honor to her",Little Women

514,"the airs of a studious young peacock.  But, alas, alas!  Pride goes",Little Women
514,"before a fall, and the revengeful Snow turned the tables with",Little Women
514,disastrous success.  No sooner had the guest paid the usual stale,Little Women
514,"compliments and bowed himself out, than Jenny, under pretense of asking",Little Women
514,"an important question, informed Mr. Davis, the teacher, that Amy March",Little Women
514,had pickled limes in her desk.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Now Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and solemnly",Little Women
514,vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the,Little Women

514,"after a long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated",Little Women
514,"novels and newspapers, had suppressed a private post office, had",Little Women
514,"forbidden distortions of the face, nicknames, and caricatures, and done",Little Women
514,all that one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in,Little Women
514,"order.  Boys are trying enough to human patience, goodness knows, but",Little Women
514,"girls are infinitely more so, especially to nervous gentlemen with",Little Women

514,"Mr. Davis knew any quantity of Greek, Latin, algebra, and ologies of",Little Women
514,"all sorts so he was called a fine teacher, and manners, morals,",Little Women
514,"feelings, and examples were not considered of any particular",Little Women
514,"importance.  It was a most unfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, and",Little Women
514,Jenny knew it.  Mr. Davis had evidently taken his coffee too strong,Little Women
514,"that morning, there was an east wind, which always affected his",Little Women
514,"neuralgia, and his pupils had not done him the credit which he felt he",Little Women

514,"of a schoolgirl, ""He was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear"".",Little Women

514,"sense of wrong and the thought of Jenny Snow helped her to bear it,",Little Women
514,"and, taking the ignominious place, she fixed her eyes on the stove",Little Women

514,"hard experience, for during the twelve years of her life she had been",Little Women
514,"governed by love alone, and a blow of that sort had never touched her",Little Women
514,before.  The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten,Little Women

514,"""If she goes I shan't, and if I don't, Laurie won't like it, and it",Little Women

514,,Little Women

514,"when you weren't asked.  You shan't stir a step, so you may just stay",Little Women
514,"where you are,"" scolded Jo, crosser than ever, having just pricked her",Little Women
514,finger in her hurry.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Sitting on the floor with one boot on, Amy began to cry and Meg to",Little Women
514,"reason with her, when Laurie called from below, and the two girls",Little Women
514,"hurried down, leaving their sister wailing.  For now and then she",Little Women
514,forgot her grown-up ways and acted like a spoiled child.  Just as the,Little Women
514,"party was setting out, Amy called over the banisters in a threatening",Little Women
514,"tone, ""You'll be sorry for this, Jo March, see if you ain't.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Fiddlesticks!"" returned Jo, slamming the door.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"They had a charming time, for _The Seven Castles Of The Diamond Lake_",Little Women
514,was as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish. But in spite of the,Little Women
514,"comical red imps, sparkling elves, and the gorgeous princes and",Little Women
514,"princesses, Jo's pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it.  The fairy",Little Women
514,"queen's yellow curls reminded her of Amy, and between the acts she",Little Women
514,amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her,Little Women
514,'sorry for it'.  She and Amy had had many lively skirmishes in the,Little Women
514,"course of their lives, for both had quick tempers and were apt to be",Little Women
514,"violent when fairly roused.  Amy teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy, and",Little Women
514,"semioccasional explosions occurred, of which both were much ashamed",Little Women
514,"afterward. Although the oldest, Jo had the least self-control, and had",Little Women
514,hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually,Little Women
514,"getting her into trouble.  Her anger never lasted long, and having",Little Women
514,"humbly confessed her fault, she sincerely repented and tried to do",Little Women
514,better. Her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a,Little Women
514,fury because she was such an angel afterward.  Poor Jo tried,Little Women
514,"desperately to be good, but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame",Little Women
514,"up and defeat her, and it took years of patient effort to subdue it.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"When they got home, they found Amy reading in the parlor. She assumed",Little Women
514,"an injured air as they came in, never lifted her eyes from her book, or",Little Women
514,asked a single question.  Perhaps curiosity might have conquered,Little Women
514,"resentment, if Beth had not been there to inquire and receive a glowing",Little Women
514,"description of the play.  On going up to put away her best hat, Jo's",Little Women
514,"first look was toward the bureau, for in their last quarrel Amy had",Little Women
514,soothed her feelings by turning Jo's top drawer upside down on the,Little Women
514,"floor.  Everything was in its place, however, and after a hasty glance",Little Women
514,"into her various closets, bags, and boxes, Jo decided that Amy had",Little Women
514,forgiven and forgotten her wrongs.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"There Jo was mistaken, for next day she made a discovery which produced",Little Women
514,"a tempest.  Meg, Beth, and Amy were sitting together, late in the",Little Women
514,"afternoon, when Jo burst into the room, looking excited and demanding",Little Women
514,"breathlessly, ""Has anyone taken my book?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg and Beth said, ""No."" at once, and looked surprised.  Amy poked the",Little Women
514,fire and said nothing.  Jo saw her color rise and was down upon her in,Little Women
514,a minute.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Amy, you've got it!""",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""That's a fib!"" cried Jo, taking her by the shoulders, and looking",Little Women
514,fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than Amy.,Little Women

514,"""It isn't.  I haven't got it, don't know where it is now, and don't",Little Women
514,"care.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You know something about it, and you'd better tell at once, or I'll",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Scold as much as you like, you'll never see your silly old book",Little Women
514,"again,"" cried Amy, getting excited in her turn.",Little Women

514,"""I burned it up.""",Little Women

514,"and I have, so...""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Amy got no farther, for Jo's hot temper mastered her, and she shook Amy",Little Women

514,anger...,Little Women

514,"""You wicked, wicked girl!  I never can write it again, and I'll never",Little Women
514,"forgive you as long as I live.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was quite beside",Little Women
514,"herself, and with a parting box on her sister's ear, she rushed out of",Little Women
514,"the room up to the old sofa in the garret, and finished her fight alone.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and, having heard",Little Women
514,"the story, soon brought Amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her",Little Women
514,"sister.  Jo's book was the pride of her heart, and was regarded by her",Little Women
514,family as a literary sprout of great promise.  It was only half a dozen,Little Women
514,"little fairy tales, but Jo had worked over them patiently, putting her",Little Women
514,"whole heart into her work, hoping to make something good enough to",Little Women
514,"print.  She had just copied them with great care, and had destroyed the",Little Women
514,"old manuscript, so that Amy's bonfire had consumed the loving work of",Little Women
514,"several years.  It seemed a small loss to others, but to Jo it was a",Little Women
514,"dreadful calamity, and she felt that it never could be made up to her.",Little Women
514,"Beth mourned as for a departed kitten, and Meg refused to defend her",Little Women
514,"pet.  Mrs. March looked grave and grieved, and Amy felt that no one",Little Women
514,would love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now,Little Women
514,regretted more than any of them.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"When the tea bell rang, Jo appeared, looking so grim and unapproachable",Little Women
514,that it took all Amy's courage to say meekly...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Please forgive me, Jo.  I'm very, very sorry.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I never shall forgive you,"" was Jo's stern answer, and from that",Little Women
514,moment she ignored Amy entirely.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"No one spoke of the great trouble, not even Mrs. March, for all had",Little Women
514,"learned by experience that when Jo was in that mood words were wasted,",Little Women
514,"and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident, or her own",Little Women
514,"generous nature, softened Jo's resentment and healed the breach.  It",Little Women
514,"was not a happy evening, for though they sewed as usual, while their",Little Women
514,"mother read aloud from Bremer, Scott, or Edgeworth, something was",Little Women
514,"wanting, and the sweet home peace was disturbed.  They felt this most",Little Women
514,"when singing time came, for Beth could only play, Jo stood dumb as a",Little Women
514,"stone, and Amy broke down, so Meg and Mother sang alone.  But in spite",Little Women
514,"of their efforts to be as cheery as larks, the flutelike voices did not",Little Women
514,"seem to chord as well as usual, and all felt out of tune.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As Jo received her good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered gently, ""My",Little Women
514,"dear, don't let the sun go down upon your anger.  Forgive each other,",Little Women
514,"help each other, and begin again tomorrow.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom, and cry her",Little Women
514,"grief and anger all away, but tears were an unmanly weakness, and she",Little Women
514,felt so deeply injured that she really couldn't quite forgive yet.  So,Little Women
514,"she winked hard, shook her head, and said gruffly because Amy was",Little Women
514,"listening, ""It was an abominable thing, and she doesn't deserve to be",Little Women
514,"forgiven.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"With that she marched off to bed, and there was no merry or",Little Women
514,confidential gossip that night.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed,",Little Women
514,"and began to wish she had not humbled herself, to feel more injured",Little Women
514,"than ever, and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which",Little Women
514,"was particularly exasperating.  Jo still looked like a thunder cloud,",Little Women
514,"and nothing went well all day.  It was bitter cold in the morning, she",Little Women
514,"dropped her precious turnover in the gutter, Aunt March had an attack",Little Women
514,"of the fidgets, Meg was sensitive, Beth would look grieved and wistful",Little Women
514,"when she got home, and Amy kept making remarks about people who were",Little Women

514,people set them a virtuous example.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Everybody is so hateful, I'll ask Laurie to go skating.  He is always",Little Women

514,exclamation.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""There!  She promised I should go next time, for this is the last ice",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't say that.  You were very naughty, and it is hard to forgive the",Little Women

514,"I guess she will, if you try her at the right minute,"" said Meg.  ""Go",Little Women
514,after them.  Don't say anything till Jo has got good-natured with,Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll try,"" said Amy, for the advice suited her, and after a flurry to",Little Women
514,"get ready, she ran after the friends, who were just disappearing over",Little Women
514,the hill.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy reached",Little Women
514,"them.  Jo saw her coming, and turned her back.  Laurie did not see, for",Little Women
514,"he was carefully skating along the shore, sounding the ice, for a warm",Little Women
514,spell had preceded the cold snap.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll go on to the first bend, and see if it's all right before we",Little Women
514,"begin to race,"" Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like a",Little Women
514,young Russian in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and blowing on",Little Women
514,"her fingers as she tried to put her skates on, but Jo never turned and",Little Women
514,"went slowly zigzagging down the river, taking a bitter, unhappy sort of",Little Women
514,satisfaction in her sister's troubles. She had cherished her anger till,Little Women
514,"it grew strong and took possession of her, as evil thoughts and",Little Women
514,"feelings always do unless cast out at once.  As Laurie turned the bend,",Little Women
514,he shouted back...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Keep near the shore.  It isn't safe in the middle."" Jo heard, but Amy",Little Women
514,was struggling to her feet and did not catch a word.  Jo glanced over,Little Women
514,"her shoulder, and the little demon she was harboring said in her ear...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No matter whether she heard or not, let her take care of herself.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie had vanished round the bend, Jo was just at the turn, and Amy,",Little Women
514,"far behind, striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle of the",Little Women
514,river.  For a minute Jo stood still with a strange feeling in her,Little Women
514,"heart, then she resolved to go on, but something held and turned her",Little Women
514,"round, just in time to see Amy throw up her hands and go down, with a",Little Women
514,"sudden crash of rotten ice, the splash of water, and a cry that made",Little Women
514,"Jo's heart stand still with fear.  She tried to call Laurie, but her",Little Women
514,"voice was gone.  She tried to rush forward, but her feet seemed to have",Little Women
514,"no strength in them, and for a second, she could only stand motionless,",Little Women
514,staring with a terror-stricken face at the little blue hood above the,Little Women
514,"black water. Something rushed swiftly by her, and Laurie's voice cried",Little Women
514,out...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Bring a rail.  Quick, quick!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"How she did it, she never knew, but for the next few minutes she worked",Little Women
514,"as if possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, who was quite self-possessed,",Little Women
514,"and lying flat, held Amy up by his arm and hockey stick till Jo dragged",Little Women
514,"a rail from the fence, and together they got the child out, more",Little Women
514,frightened than hurt.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Now then, we must walk her home as fast as we can.  Pile our things on",Little Women
514,"her, while I get off these confounded skates,"" cried Laurie, wrapping",Little Women
514,"his coat round Amy, and tugging away at the straps which never seemed",Little Women
514,so intricate before.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Shivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home, and after an",Little Women
514,"exciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets before a hot",Little Women
514,"fire.  During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken but flown about,",Little Women
514,"looking pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn, and",Little Women
514,her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles. When,Little Women
514,"Amy was comfortably asleep, the house quiet, and Mrs. March sitting by",Little Women
514,"the bed, she called Jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Are you sure she is safe?"" whispered Jo, looking remorsefully at the",Little Women
514,"golden head, which might have been swept away from her sight forever",Little Women
514,under the treacherous ice.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Quite safe, dear.  She is not hurt, and won't even take cold, I think,",Little Women
514,"you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly,"" replied",Little Women
514,her mother cheerfully.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Laurie did it all.  I only let her go.  Mother, if she should die, it",Little Women
514,"would be my fault.""  And Jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of",Little Women
514,"penitent tears, telling all that had happened, bitterly condemning her",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""It's my dreadful temper!  I try to cure it, I think I have, and then",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,Jo saw that her mother's eyes filled and her lips trembled as she,Little Women

514,,Little Women

514,"""I thought I'd grieved you.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, dear, but speaking of Father reminded me how much I miss him, how",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Yet you told him to go, Mother, and didn't cry when he went, and never",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""I gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears till he was",Little Women
514,"gone.  Why should I complain, when we both have merely done our duty",Little Women
514,and will surely be the happier for it in the end?  If I don't seem to,Little Women
514,"need help, it is because I have a better friend, even than Father, to",Little Women
514,"comfort and sustain me.  My child, the troubles and temptations of your",Little Women
514,"life are beginning and may be many, but you can overcome and outlive",Little Women
514,them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your,Little Women
514,Heavenly Father as you do that of your earthly one.  The more you love,Little Women
514,"and trust Him, the nearer you will feel to Him, and the less you will",Little Women
514,depend on human power and wisdom.  His love and care never tire or,Little Women
514,"change, can never be taken from you, but may become the source of",Little Women
514,"lifelong peace, happiness, and strength.  Believe this heartily, and go",Little Women
514,"to God with all your little cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as",Little Women
514,"freely and confidingly as you come to your mother.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo's only answer was to hold her mother close, and in the silence which",Little Women
514,followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart,Little Women
514,"without words.  For in that sad yet happy hour, she had learned not",Little Women
514,"only the bitterness of remorse and despair, but the sweetness of",Little Women
514,"self-denial and self-control, and led by her mother's hand, she had",Little Women
514,drawn nearer to the Friend who always welcomes every child with a love,Little Women
514,"stronger than that of any father, tenderer than that of any mother.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Amy stirred and sighed in her sleep, and as if eager to begin at once",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise.  A whole",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""And such lovely weather, I'm so glad of that,"" added Beth, tidily",Little Women

514,"""I wish I was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice",Little Women

514,which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What did Mother give you out of the treasure box?"" asked Amy, who had",Little Women
514,not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which Mrs.,Little Women
514,"March kept a few relics of past splendor, as gifts for her girls when",Little Women
514,the proper time came.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""A pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a lovely blue",Little Women

514,,Little Women

514,possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use.,Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,"see, there's my new gray walking suit, just curl up the feather in my",Little Women
514,"hat, Beth, then my poplin for Sunday and the small party, it looks",Little Women

514,"dear!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Never mind, you've got the tarlaton for the big party, and you always",Little Women

514,of finery in which her soul delighted.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It isn't low-necked, and it doesn't sweep enough, but it will have to",Little Women
514,"do.  My blue housedress looks so well, turned and freshly trimmed, that",Little Women
514,I feel as if I'd got a new one.  My silk sacque isn't a bit the,Little Women
514,"fashion, and my bonnet doesn't look like Sallie's.  I didn't like to",Little Women
514,"say anything, but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella.  I told",Little Women
514,"Mother black with a white handle, but she forgot and bought a green one",Little Women
514,"with a yellowish handle.  It's strong and neat, so I ought not to",Little Women
514,"complain, but I know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie's silk one",Little Women

514,"""I won't be so silly, or hurt Marmee's feelings, when she took so much",Little Women

514,"and sort of elegant, with two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps. Would you put",Little Women

514,fresh from Hannah's hands.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, I wouldn't, for the smart caps won't match the plain gowns without",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""So I did!  Well, I am happy, and I won't fret, but it does seem as if",Little Women
514,"the more one gets the more one wants, doesn't it?  There now, the trays",Little Women
514,"are ready, and everything in but my ball dress, which I shall leave for",Little Women
514,"Mother to pack,"" said Meg, cheering up, as she glanced from the",Little Women
514,"half-filled trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlaton,",Little Women
514,which she called her 'ball dress' with an important air.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The next day was fine, and Meg departed in style for a fortnight of",Little Women
514,novelty and pleasure.  Mrs. March had consented to the visit rather,Little Women
514,"reluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented",Little Women
514,"than she went.  But she begged so hard, and Sallie had promised to take",Little Women
514,"good care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a",Little Women
514,"winter of irksome work that the mother yielded, and the daughter went",Little Women
514,to take her first taste of fashionable life.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The Moffats were very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather daunted,",Little Women
514,"at first, by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its",Little Women
514,"occupants.  But they were kindly people, in spite of the frivolous life",Little Women
514,"they led, and soon put their guest at her ease. Perhaps Meg felt,",Little Women
514,"without understanding why, that they were not particularly cultivated",Little Women
514,"or intelligent people, and that all their gilding could not quite",Little Women
514,conceal the ordinary material of which they were made.  It certainly,Little Women
514,"was agreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her",Little Women
514,"best frock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself.  It suited her",Little Women
514,"exactly, and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of",Little Women
514,"those about her, to put on little airs and graces, use French phrases,",Little Women
514,"crimp her hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the fashions as",Little Women
514,"well as she could.  The more she saw of Annie Moffat's pretty things,",Little Women
514,the more she envied her and sighed to be rich.  Home now looked bare,Little Women
514,"and dismal as she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she",Little Women
514,"felt that she was a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of",Little Women
514,the new gloves and silk stockings.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She had not much time for repining, however, for the three young girls",Little Women
514,"were busily employed in 'having a good time'.  They shopped, walked,",Little Women
514,"rode, and called all day, went to theaters and operas or frolicked at",Little Women
514,"home in the evening, for Annie had many friends and knew how to",Little Women
514,"entertain them.  Her older sisters were very fine young ladies, and one",Little Women
514,"was engaged, which was extremely interesting and romantic, Meg thought.",Little Women
514,"Mr. Moffat was a fat, jolly old gentleman, who knew her father, and",Little Women
514,"Mrs. Moffat, a fat, jolly old lady, who took as great a fancy to Meg as",Little Women
514,"her daughter had done.  Everyone petted her, and 'Daisey', as they",Little Women
514,"called her, was in a fair way to have her head turned.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"When the evening for the small party came, she found that the poplin",Little Women
514,"wouldn't do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin dresses",Little Women
514,"and making themselves very fine indeed.  So out came the tarlatan,",Little Women
514,"looking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie's crisp new",Little Women
514,"one.  Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another, and her",Little Women
514,"cheeks began to burn, for with all her gentleness she was very proud.",Little Women
514,"No one said a word about it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and",Little Women
514,"Annie to tie her sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white",Little Women
514,"arms.  But in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her",Little Women
514,"heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others",Little Women
514,"laughed, chattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies.  The hard,",Little Women
514,"bitter feeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box",Little Women
514,"of flowers.  Before she could speak, Annie had the cover off, and all",Little Women
514,"were exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's for Belle, of course, George always sends her some, but these are",Little Women
514,"altogether ravishing,"" cried Annie, with a great sniff.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""They are for Miss March, the man said.  And here's a note,"" put in the",Little Women
514,"maid, holding it to Meg.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What fun!  Who are they from?  Didn't know you had a lover,"" cried the",Little Women
514,"girls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""The note is from Mother, and the flowers from Laurie,"" said Meg",Little Women
514,"simply, yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, indeed!"" said Annie with a funny look, as Meg slipped the note",Little Women
514,"into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity, and false",Little Women
514,"pride, for the few loving words had done her good, and the flowers",Little Women
514,cheered her up by their beauty.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Feeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses for",Little Women
514,"herself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the",Little Women
514,"breasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so prettily that",Little Women
514,"Clara, the elder sister, told her she was 'the sweetest little thing",Little Women
514,"she ever saw', and they looked quite charmed with her small attention.",Little Women
514,"Somehow the kind act finished her despondency, and when all the rest",Little Women
514,"went to show themselves to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a happy, bright-eyed",Little Women
514,"face in the mirror, as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and",Little Women
514,fastened the roses in the dress that didn't strike her as so very,Little Women
514,shabby now.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced to her",Little Women
514,"heart's content.  Everyone was very kind, and she had three",Little Women
514,"compliments.  Annie made her sing, and some one said she had a",Little Women
514,remarkably fine voice.  Major Lincoln asked who 'the fresh little girl,Little Women
514,"with the beautiful eyes' was, and Mr. Moffat insisted on dancing with",Little Women
514,"her because she 'didn't dawdle, but had some spring in her', as he",Little Women
514,"gracefully expressed it.  So altogether she had a very nice time, till",Little Women
514,"she overheard a bit of conversation, which disturbed her extremely.",Little Women
514,"She was sitting just inside the conservatory, waiting for her partner",Little Women
514,"to bring her an ice, when she heard a voice ask on the other side of",Little Women

514,"""How old is he?""",Little Women

514,"""Sixteen or seventeen, I should say,"" replied another voice.",Little Women

514,Moffat.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""She told that fib about her momma, as if she did know, and colored up",Little Women
514,when the flowers came quite prettily.  Poor thing! She'd be so nice if,Little Women
514,she was only got up in style.  Do you think she'd be offended if we,Little Women
514,"offered to lend her a dress for Thursday?"" asked another voice.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""She's proud, but I don't believe she'd mind, for that dowdy tarlaton",Little Women
514,"is all she has got.  She may tear it tonight, and that will be a good",Little Women
514,"excuse for offering a decent one.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Here Meg's partner appeared, to find her looking much flushed and",Little Women
514,"rather agitated.  She was proud, and her pride was useful just then,",Little Women
514,"for it helped her hide her mortification, anger, and disgust at what",Little Women
514,"she had just heard.  For, innocent and unsuspicious as she was, she",Little Women
514,could not help understanding the gossip of her friends.  She tried to,Little Women
514,"forget it, but could not, and kept repeating to herself, ""Mrs. M.  has",Little Women
514,"made her plans,"" ""that fib about her mamma,"" and ""dowdy tarlaton,"" till",Little Women
514,she was ready to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for,Little Women
514,"advice.  As that was impossible, she did her best to seem gay, and",Little Women
514,"being rather excited, she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an",Little Women
514,effort she was making. She was very glad when it was all over and she,Little Women
514,"was quiet in her bed, where she could think and wonder and fume till",Little Women
514,her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears.,Little Women
514,"Those foolish, yet well meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and",Little Women
514,much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived,Little Women
514,as happily as a child.  Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoiled,Little Women
514,by the silly speeches she had overheard.  Her faith in her mother was a,Little Women
514,"little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her by Mrs. Moffat,",Little Women
514,"who judged others by herself, and the sensible resolution to be",Little Women
514,contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor man's daughter,Little Women
514,was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby,Little Women
514,dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Poor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy, half",Little Women
514,"resentful toward her friends, and half ashamed of herself for not",Little Women
514,speaking out frankly and setting everything right.  Everybody dawdled,Little Women
514,"that morning, and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even",Little Women
514,to take up their worsted work.  Something in the manner of her friends,Little Women
514,"struck Meg at once.  They treated her with more respect, she thought,",Little Women
514,"took quite a tender interest in what she said, and looked at her with",Little Women
514,eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity.  All this surprised and flattered,Little Women
514,"her, though she did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from",Little Women
514,"her writing, and said, with a sentimental air...",Little Women

514,"burst upon them like Cinderella and her godmother going to the ball,""",Little Women
514,said Belle in her persuasive tone.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg couldn't refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to see if",Little Women
514,she would be 'a little beauty' after touching up caused her to accept,Little Women
514,and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward the Moffats.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"On the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid, and",Little Women
514,between them they turned Meg into a fine lady.  They crimped and curled,Little Women
514,"her hair, they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder,",Little Women
514,"touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder, and Hortense",Little Women
514,"would have added 'a soupcon of rouge', if Meg had not rebelled.  They",Little Women
514,"laced her into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight she could hardly",Little Women
514,breathe and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in,Little Women
514,"the mirror.  A set of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace,",Little Women
514,"brooch, and even earrings, for Hortense tied them on with a bit of pink",Little Women
514,"silk which did not show.  A cluster of tea-rose buds at the bosom, and",Little Women
514,"a ruche, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty, white shoulders,",Little Women
514,and a pair of high-heeled silk boots satisfied the last wish of her,Little Women
514,"heart.  A lace handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a shoulder",Little Women
514,"holder finished her off, and Miss Belle surveyed her with the",Little Women
514,satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Mademoiselle is charmante, tres jolie, is she not?"" cried Hortense,",Little Women
514,clasping her hands in an affected rapture.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Come and show yourself,"" said Miss Belle, leading the way to the room",Little Women
514,where the others were waiting.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As Meg went rustling after, with her long skirts trailing, her earrings",Little Women
514,"tinkling, her curls waving, and her heart beating, she felt as if her",Little Women
514,"fun had really begun at last, for the mirror had plainly told her that",Little Women
514,she was 'a little beauty'.  Her friends repeated the pleasing phrase,Little Women
514,"enthusiastically, and for several minutes she stood, like a jackdaw in",Little Women
514,"the fable, enjoying her borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered like",Little Women
514,a party of magpies.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of her skirt",Little Women
514,"and those French heels, or she will trip herself up.  Take your silver",Little Women
514,"butterfly, and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head,",Little Women
514,"Clara, and don't any of you disturb the charming work of my hands,""",Little Women
514,"said Belle, as she hurried away, looking well pleased with her success.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You don't look a bit like yourself, but you are very nice. I'm nowhere",Little Women
514,"beside you, for Belle has heaps of taste, and you're quite French, I",Little Women
514,"assure you.  Let your flowers hang, don't be so careful of them, and be",Little Women
514,"sure you don't trip,"" returned Sallie, trying not to care that Meg was",Little Women
514,prettier than herself.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Keeping that warning carefully in mind, Margaret got safely down stairs",Little Women
514,and sailed into the drawing rooms where the Moffats and a few early,Little Women
514,guests were assembled.  She very soon discovered that there is a charm,Little Women
514,about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures,Little Women
514,"their respect.  Several young ladies, who had taken no notice of her",Little Women
514,"before, were very affectionate all of a sudden.  Several young",Little Women
514,"gentlemen, who had only stared at her at the other party, now not only",Little Women
514,"stared, but asked to be introduced, and said all manner of foolish but",Little Women
514,"agreeable things to her, and several old ladies, who sat on the sofas,",Little Women
514,"and criticized the rest of the party, inquired who she was with an air",Little Women
514,of interest.  She heard Mrs. Moffat reply to one of them...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Daisy March--father a colonel in the army--one of our first families,",Little Women
514,"but reverses of fortune, you know; intimate friends of the Laurences;",Little Women
514,"sweet creature, I assure you; my Ned is quite wild about her.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Dear me!"" said the old lady, putting up her glass for another",Little Women
514,"observation of Meg, who tried to look as if she had not heard and been",Little Women
514,rather shocked at Mrs. Moffat's fibs. The 'queer feeling' did not pass,Little Women
514,"away, but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady and so",Little Women
514,"got on pretty well, though the tight dress gave her a side-ache, the",Little Women
514,"train kept getting under her feet, and she was in constant fear lest",Little Women
514,her earrings should fly off and get lost or broken.  She was flirting,Little Women
514,her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried,Little Women
514,"to be witty, when she suddenly stopped laughing and looked confused,",Little Women
514,"for just opposite, she saw Laurie.  He was staring at her with",Little Women
514,"undisguised surprise, and disapproval also, she thought, for though he",Little Women
514,"bowed and smiled, yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and",Little Women
514,"wish she had her old dress on. To complete her confusion, she saw Belle",Little Women
514,"nudge Annie, and both glance from her to Laurie, who, she was happy to",Little Women
514,"see, looked unusually boyish and shy.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Silly creatures, to put such thoughts into my head.  I won't care for",Little Women
514,"it, or let it change me a bit,"" thought Meg, and rustled across the",Little Women
514,room to shake hands with her friend.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm glad you came, I was afraid you wouldn't."" she said, with her most",Little Women
514,grown-up air.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Jo wanted me to come, and tell her how you looked, so I did,"" answered",Little Women
514,"Laurie, without turning his eyes upon her, though he half smiled at her",Little Women
514,maternal tone.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What shall you tell her?"" asked Meg, full of curiosity to know his",Little Women
514,"opinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I shall say I didn't know you, for you look so grown-up and unlike",Little Women
514,"yourself, I'm quite afraid of you,"" he said, fumbling at his glove",Little Women
514,button.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How absurd of you!  The girls dressed me up for fun, and I rather like",Little Women
514,"it.  Wouldn't Jo stare if she saw me?"" said Meg, bent on making him say",Little Women
514,whether he thought her improved or not.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, I think she would,"" returned Laurie gravely.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't you like me so?"" asked Meg.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, I don't,"" was the blunt reply.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Why not?"" in an anxious tone.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He glanced at her frizzled head, bare shoulders, and fantastically",Little Women
514,"trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than his answer,",Little Women
514,which had not a particle of his usual politeness in it.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I don't like fuss and feathers.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"That was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself, and Meg",Little Women
514,"walked away, saying petulantly, ""You are the rudest boy I ever saw.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Feeling very much ruffled, she went and stood at a quiet window to cool",Little Women
514,"her cheeks, for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant",Little Women
514,"color.  As she stood there, Major Lincoln passed by, and a minute after",Little Women
514,she heard him saying to his mother...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""They are making a fool of that little girl.  I wanted you to see her,",Little Women
514,"but they have spoiled her entirely.  She's nothing but a doll tonight.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, dear!"" sighed Meg.  ""I wish I'd been sensible and worn my own",Little Women
514,"things, then I should not have disgusted other people, or felt so",Little Women
514,"uncomfortable and ashamed of myself.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She leaned her forehead on the cool pane, and stood half hidden by the",Little Women
514,"curtains, never minding that her favorite waltz had begun, till some",Little Women
514,"one touched her, and turning, she saw Laurie, looking penitent, as he",Little Women
514,"said, with his very best bow and his hand out...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Please forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm afraid it will be too disagreeable to you,"" said Meg, trying to",Little Women
514,look offended and failing entirely.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not a bit of it, I'm dying to do it.  Come, I'll be good. I don't like",Little Women
514,"your gown, but I do think you are just splendid."" And he waved his",Little Women
514,"hands, as if words failed to express his admiration.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg smiled and relented, and whispered as they stood waiting to catch",Little Women
514,"the time, ""Take care my skirt doesn't trip you up.  It's the plague of",Little Women
514,"my life and I was a goose to wear it.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Pin it round your neck, and then it will be useful,"" said Laurie,",Little Women
514,"looking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently approved of.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Away they went fleetly and gracefully, for having practiced at home,",Little Women
514,"they were well matched, and the blithe young couple were a pleasant",Little Women
514,"sight to see, as they twirled merrily round and round, feeling more",Little Women
514,friendly than ever after their small tiff.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Laurie, I want you to do me a favor, will you?"" said Meg, as he stood",Little Women
514,"fanning her when her breath gave out, which it did very soon though she",Little Women
514,would not own why.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Won't I!"" said Laurie, with alacrity.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Please don't tell them at home about my dress tonight. They won't",Little Women
514,"understand the joke, and it will worry Mother.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Then why did you do it?"" said Laurie's eyes, so plainly that Meg",Little Women
514,hastily added...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I shall tell them myself all about it, and 'fess' to Mother how silly",Little Women
514,"I've been.  But I'd rather do it myself.  So you'll not tell, will you?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I give you my word I won't, only what shall I say when they ask me?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Just say I looked pretty well and was having a good time.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll say the first with all my heart, but how about the other?  You",Little Women
514,"don't look as if you were having a good time.  Are you?"" And Laurie",Little Women
514,looked at her with an expression which made her answer in a whisper...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, not just now.  Don't think I'm horrid.  I only wanted a little",Little Women
514,"fun, but this sort doesn't pay, I find, and I'm getting tired of it.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Here comes Ned Moffat.  What does he want?"" said Laurie, knitting his",Little Women
514,black brows as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a,Little Women
514,pleasant addition to the party.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""He put his name down for three dances, and I suppose he's coming for",Little Women
514,"them.  What a bore!"" said Meg, assuming a languid air which amused",Little Women
514,Laurie immensely.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He did not speak to her again till suppertime, when he saw her drinking",Little Women
514,"champagne with Ned and his friend Fisher, who were behaving 'like a",Little Women
514,"pair of fools', as Laurie said to himself, for he felt a brotherly sort",Little Women
514,of right to watch over the Marches and fight their battles whenever a,Little Women
514,defender was needed.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You'll have a splitting headache tomorrow, if you drink much of that.",Little Women
514,"I wouldn't, Meg, your mother doesn't like it, you know,"" he whispered,",Little Women
514,"leaning over her chair, as Ned turned to refill her glass and Fisher",Little Women
514,stooped to pick up her fan.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm not Meg tonight, I'm 'a doll' who does all sorts of crazy things.",Little Women
514,Tomorrow I shall put away my 'fuss and feathers' and be desperately,Little Women
514,"good again,"" she answered with an affected little laugh.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Wish tomorrow was here, then,"" muttered Laurie, walking off,",Little Women
514,ill-pleased at the change he saw in her.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg danced and flirted, chattered and giggled, as the other girls did.",Little Women
514,"After supper she undertook the German, and blundered through it, nearly",Little Women
514,"upsetting her partner with her long skirt, and romping in a way that",Little Women
514,"scandalized Laurie, who looked on and meditated a lecture.  But he got",Little Women
514,"no chance to deliver it, for Meg kept away from him till he came to say",Little Women
514,good night.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Remember!"" she said, trying to smile, for the splitting headache had",Little Women
514,already begun.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Silence a la mort,"" replied Laurie, with a melodramatic flourish, as",Little Women
514,he went away.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"This little bit of byplay excited Annie's curiosity, but Meg was too",Little Women
514,"tired for gossip and went to bed, feeling as if she had been to a",Little Women
514,masquerade and hadn't enjoyed herself as much as she expected.  She was,Little Women
514,"sick all the next day, and on Saturday went home, quite used up with",Little Women
514,her fortnight's fun and feeling that she had 'sat in the lap of luxury',Little Women
514,long enough.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company manners on all",Little Women
514,"the time.  Home is a nice place, though it isn't splendid,"" said Meg,",Little Women

514,and Jo on the Sunday evening.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm glad to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid home would seem",Little Women
514,"dull and poor to you after your fine quarters,"" replied her mother, who",Little Women
514,had given her many anxious looks that day.  For motherly eyes are quick,Little Women
514,to see any change in children's faces.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a,Little Women
514,"charming time she had had, but something still seemed to weigh upon her",Little Women
514,"spirits, and when the younger girls were gone to bed, she sat",Little Women
514,"thoughtfully staring at the fire, saying little and looking worried.",Little Women
514,"As the clock struck nine and Jo proposed bed, Meg suddenly left her",Little Women
514,"chair and, taking Beth's stool, leaned her elbows on her mother's knee,",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Of course not.  Don't I always tell you everything?  I was ashamed to",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""We are prepared,"" said Mrs. March, smiling but looking a little",Little Women
514,anxious.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you that they",Little Women
514,"powdered and squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a",Little Women

514,"he didn't say so, and one man called me 'a doll'.  I knew it was silly,",Little Women
514,"but they flattered me and said I was a beauty, and quantities of",Little Women
514,"nonsense, so I let them make a fool of me.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Is that all?"" asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently at the downcast",Little Women

514,blame her little follies.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and was",Little Women
514,"altogether abominable,"" said Meg self-reproachfully.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""There is something more, I think.""  And Mrs. March smoothed the soft",Little Women
514,"cheek, which suddenly grew rosy as Meg answered slowly...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes.  It's very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate to have",Little Women
514,"people say and think such things about us and Laurie.""",Little Women

514,pleased that such ideas should be put into Meg's innocent mind.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, if that isn't the greatest rubbish I ever heard,"" cried Jo",Little Women
514,"indignantly.  ""Why didn't you pop out and tell them so on the spot?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I couldn't, it was so embarrassing for me.  I couldn't help hearing at",Little Women

514,"As spring came on, a new set of amusements became the fashion, and the",Little Women
514,lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts.,Little Women
514,"The garden had to be put in order, and each sister had a quarter of the",Little Women
514,"little plot to do what she liked with.  Hannah used to say, ""I'd know",Little Women
514,"which each of them gardings belonged to, ef I see 'em in Chiny,"" and so",Little Women
514,"she might, for the girls' tastes differed as much as their characters.",Little Women
514,"Meg's had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange tree in it.",Little Women
514,"Jo's bed was never alike two seasons, for she was always trying",Little Women
514,"experiments.  This year it was to be a plantation of sun flowers, the",Little Women
514,seeds of which cheerful and aspiring plant were to feed Aunt,Little Women
514,Cockle-top and her family of chicks.  Beth had old-fashioned fragrant,Little Women
514,"flowers in her garden, sweet peas and mignonette, larkspur, pinks,",Little Women
514,"pansies, and southernwood, with chickweed for the birds and catnip for",Little Women
514,"the pussies.  Amy had a bower in hers, rather small and earwiggy, but",Little Women
514,"very pretty to look at, with honeysuckle and morning-glories hanging",Little Women
514,"their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it, tall",Little Women
514,"white lilies, delicate ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants",Little Women
514,as would consent to blossom there.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Gardening, walks, rows on the river, and flower hunts employed the fine",Little Women
514,"days, and for rainy ones, they had house diversions, some old, some",Little Women
514,"new, all more or less original.  One of these was the 'P.C.', for as",Little Women
514,"secret societies were the fashion, it was thought proper to have one,",Little Women
514,"and as all of the girls admired Dickens, they called themselves the",Little Women
514,"Pickwick Club.  With a few interruptions, they had kept this up for a",Little Women
514,"year, and met every Saturday evening in the big garret, on which",Little Women
514,occasions the ceremonies were as follows:  Three chairs were arranged,Little Women
514,"in a row before a table on which was a lamp, also four white badges,",Little Women
514,"with a big 'P.C.' in different colors on each, and the weekly newspaper",Little Women
514,"called, The Pickwick Portfolio, to which all contributed something,",Little Women
514,"while Jo, who reveled in pens and ink, was the editor. At seven",Little Women
514,"o'clock, the four members ascended to the clubroom, tied their badges",Little Women
514,"round their heads, and took their seats with great solemnity.  Meg, as",Little Women
514,"the eldest, was Samuel Pickwick, Jo, being of a literary turn, Augustus",Little Women
514,"Snodgrass, Beth, because she was round and rosy, Tracy Tupman, and Amy,",Little Women
514,"who was always trying to do what she couldn't, was Nathaniel Winkle.",Little Women
514,"Pickwick, the president, read the paper, which was filled with original",Little Women
514,"tales, poetry, local news, funny advertisements, and hints, in which",Little Women
514,they good-naturedly reminded each other of their faults and short,Little Women
514,"comings.  On one occasion, Mr. Pickwick put on a pair of spectacles",Little Women
514,"without any glass, rapped upon the table, hemmed, and having stared",Little Women
514,"hard at Mr. Snodgrass, who was tilting back in his chair, till he",Little Women
514,"arranged himself properly, began to read:",Little Women

514,flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You rogue!  You traitor!  Jo, how could you?"" cried the three girls,",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""The coolness of you two rascals is amazing,"" began Mr. Pickwick,",Little Women
514,trying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in producing an,Little Women
514,"amiable smile.  But the new member was equal to the occasion, and",Little Women
514,"rising, with a grateful salutation to the Chair, said in the most",Little Women
514,"engaging manner, ""Mr. President and ladies--I beg pardon,",Little Women
514,"gentlemen--allow me to introduce myself as Sam Weller, the very humble",Little Women
514,"servant of the club.""",Little Women

514,"""My faithful friend and noble patron,"" continued Laurie with a wave of",Little Women
514,"the hand, ""who has so flatteringly presented me, is not to be blamed",Little Women
514,"for the base stratagem of tonight.  I planned it, and she only gave in",Little Women
514,"after lots of teasing.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Come now, don't lay it all on yourself.  You know I proposed the",Little Women
514,"cupboard,"" broke in Snodgrass, who was enjoying the joke amazingly.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Never mind what she says.  I'm the wretch that did it, sir,"" said the",Little Women
514,"new member, with a Welleresque nod to Mr. Pickwick.  ""But on my honor,",Little Women
514,"I never will do so again, and henceforth devote myself to the interest",Little Women
514,"of this immortal club.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Hear!  Hear!"" cried Jo, clashing the lid of the warming pan like a",Little Women

514,benignly.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude for the",Little Women
514,"honor done me, and as a means of promoting friendly relations between",Little Women
514,"adjoining nations, I have set up a post office in the hedge in the",Little Women
514,"lower corner of the garden, a fine, spacious building with padlocks on",Little Women
514,"the doors and every convenience for the mails, also the females, if I",Little Women
514,"may be allowed the expression.  It's the old martin house, but I've",Little Women
514,"stopped up the door and made the roof open, so it will hold all sorts",Little Women
514,"of things, and save our valuable time.  Letters, manuscripts, books,",Little Women
514,"and bundles can be passed in there, and as each nation has a key, it",Little Women
514,"will be uncommonly nice, I fancy.  Allow me to present the club key,",Little Women
514,"and with many thanks for your favor, take my seat.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Great applause as Mr. Weller deposited a little key on the table and,Little Women
514,"subsided, the warming pan clashed and waved wildly, and it was some",Little Women
514,"time before order could be restored.  A long discussion followed, and",Little Women
514,"everyone came out surprising, for everyone did her best.  So it was an",Little Women
514,"unusually lively meeting, and did not adjourn till a late hour, when it",Little Women
514,broke up with three shrill cheers for the new member.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"No one ever regretted the admittance of Sam Weller, for a more devoted,",Little Women
514,"well-behaved, and jovial member no club could have. He certainly did",Little Women
514,"add 'spirit' to the meetings, and 'a tone' to the paper, for his",Little Women
514,"orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions were excellent,",Little Women
514,"being patriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic, but never",Little Women
514,"sentimental.  Jo regarded them as worthy of Bacon, Milton, or",Little Women
514,"Shakespeare, and remodeled her own works with good effect, she thought.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The P.  O.  was a capital little institution, and flourished",Little Women
514,"wonderfully, for nearly as many queer things passed through it as",Little Women
514,"through the real post office.  Tragedies and cravats, poetry and",Little Women
514,"pickles, garden seeds and long letters, music and gingerbread, rubbers,",Little Women
514,"invitations, scoldings, and puppies.  The old gentleman liked the fun,",Little Women
514,"and amused himself by sending odd bundles, mysterious messages, and",Little Women
514,"funny telegrams, and his gardener, who was smitten with Hannah's",Little Women
514,"charms, actually sent a love letter to Jo's care.  How they laughed",Little Women

514,"""The first of June!  The Kings are off to the seashore tomorrow, and",Little Women
514,"I'm free.  Three months' vacation--how I shall enjoy it!"" exclaimed",Little Women
514,"Meg, coming home one warm day to find Jo laid upon the sofa in an",Little Women
514,"unusual state of exhaustion, while Beth took off her dusty boots, and",Little Women
514,Amy made lemonade for the refreshment of the whole party.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Aunt March went today, for which, oh, be joyful!"" said Jo. ""I was",Little Women
514,"mortally afraid she'd ask me to go with her.  If she had, I should have",Little Women
514,"felt as if I ought to do it, but Plumfield is about as gay as a",Little Women
514,"churchyard, you know, and I'd rather be excused. We had a flurry",Little Women
514,"getting the old lady off, and I had a fright every time she spoke to",Little Women
514,"me, for I was in such a hurry to be through that I was uncommonly",Little Women
514,"helpful and sweet, and feared she'd find it impossible to part from me.",Little Women
514,"I quaked till she was fairly in the carriage, and had a final fright,",Little Women
514,"for as it drove of, she popped out her head, saying, 'Josyphine, won't",Little Women
514,"you--?' I didn't hear any more, for I basely turned and fled.  I did",Little Women
514,"actually run, and whisked round the corner where I felt safe.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Poor old Jo!  She came in looking as if bears were after her,"" said",Little Women
514,"Beth, as she cuddled her sister's feet with a motherly air.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Aunt March is a regular samphire, is she not?"" observed Amy, tasting",Little Women
514,her mixture critically.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""She means vampire, not seaweed, but it doesn't matter.  It's too warm",Little Women
514,"to be particular about one's parts of speech,"" murmured Jo.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What shall you do all your vacation?"" asked Amy, changing the subject",Little Women
514,with tact.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I shall lie abed late, and do nothing,"" replied Meg, from the depths",Little Women
514,"of the rocking chair.  ""I've been routed up early all winter and had to",Little Women
514,"spend my days working for other people, so now I'm going to rest and",Little Women
514,"revel to my heart's content.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No,"" said Jo, ""that dozy way wouldn't suit me.  I've laid in a heap of",Little Women

514,"the old apple tree, when I'm not having l----""",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,correction.,Little Women

514,"""Don't let us do any lessons, Beth, for a while, but play all the time",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, I will, if Mother doesn't mind.  I want to learn some new songs,",Little Women
514,and my children need fitting up for the summer.  They are dreadfully,Little Women
514,"out of order and really suffering for clothes.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""May we, Mother?"" asked Meg, turning to Mrs. March, who sat sewing in",Little Women
514,what they called 'Marmee's corner'.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You may try your experiment for a week and see how you like it.  I",Little Women
514,think by Saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as,Little Women
514,"bad as all work and no play.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, dear, no!  It will be delicious, I'm sure,"" said Meg complacently.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I now propose a toast, as my 'friend and pardner, Sairy Gamp', says.",Little Women
514,"Fun forever, and no grubbing!"" cried Jo, rising, glass in hand, as the",Little Women
514,lemonade went round.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"They all drank it merrily, and began the experiment by lounging for the",Little Women
514,"rest of the day.  Next morning, Meg did not appear till ten o'clock.",Little Women
514,"Her solitary breakfast did not taste good, and the room seemed lonely",Little Women
514,"and untidy, for Jo had not filled the vases, Beth had not dusted, and",Little Women
514,Amy's books lay scattered about.  Nothing was neat and pleasant but,Little Women
514,"'Marmee's corner', which looked as usual.  And there Meg sat, to 'rest",Little Women
514,"and read', which meant to yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses",Little Women
514,she would get with her salary.  Jo spent the morning on the river with,Little Women
514,"Laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over _The Wide, Wide",Little Women
514,"World_, up in the apple tree.  Beth began by rummaging everything out",Little Women
514,"of the big closet where her family resided, but getting tired before",Little Women
514,"half done, she left her establishment topsy-turvy and went to her",Little Women
514,"music, rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash. Amy arranged her",Little Women
514,"bower, put on her best white frock, smoothed her curls, and sat down to",Little Women
514,"draw under the honeysuckle, hoping someone would see and inquire who",Little Women
514,the young artist was.  As no one appeared but an inquisitive,Little Women
514,"daddy-longlegs, who examined her work with interest, she went to walk,",Little Women
514,"got caught in a shower, and came home dripping.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"At teatime they compared notes, and all agreed that it had been a",Little Women
514,"delightful, though unusually long day.  Meg, who went shopping in the",Little Women
514,"afternoon and got a 'sweet blue muslin', had discovered, after she had",Little Women
514,"cut the breadths off, that it wouldn't wash, which mishap made her",Little Women
514,"slightly cross.  Jo had burned the skin off her nose boating, and got a",Little Women
514,raging headache by reading too long.  Beth was worried by the confusion,Little Women
514,of her closet and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at,Little Women
514,"once, and Amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock, for Katy",Little Women
514,"Brown's party was to be the next day and now like Flora McFlimsey, she",Little Women
514,"had 'nothing to wear'.  But these were mere trifles, and they assured",Little Women
514,"their mother that the experiment was working finely.  She smiled, said",Little Women
514,"nothing, and with Hannah's help did their neglected work, keeping home",Little Women
514,pleasant and the domestic machinery running smoothly.  It was,Little Women
514,astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was,Little Women
514,produced by the 'resting and reveling' process.  The days kept getting,Little Women
514,"longer and longer, the weather was unusually variable and so were",Little Women
514,"tempers; an unsettled feeling possessed everyone, and Satan found",Little Women
514,"plenty of mischief for the idle hands to do.  As the height of luxury,",Little Women
514,"Meg put out some of her sewing, and then found time hang so heavily,",Little Women
514,that she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to,Little Women
514,furbish them up a la Moffat.  Jo read till her eyes gave out and she,Little Women
514,"was sick of books, got so fidgety that even good-natured Laurie had a",Little Women
514,"quarrel with her, and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished",Little Women
514,"she had gone with Aunt March.  Beth got on pretty well, for she was",Little Women
514,"constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no work, and fell",Little Women
514,back into her old ways now and then.  But something in the air affected,Little Women
514,"her, and more than once her tranquility was much disturbed, so much so",Little Women
514,that on one occasion she actually shook poor dear Joanna and told her,Little Women
514,"she was 'a fright'.  Amy fared worst of all, for her resources were",Little Women
514,"small, and when her sisters left her to amuse herself, she soon found",Little Women
514,that accomplished and important little self a great burden.  She didn't,Little Women
514,"like dolls, fairy tales were childish, and one couldn't draw all the",Little Women
514,"time.  Tea parties didn't amount to much, neither did picnics, unless",Little Women
514,"very well conducted.  ""If one could have a fine house, full of nice",Little Women
514,"girls, or go traveling, the summer would be delightful, but to stay at",Little Women
514,home with three selfish sisters and a grown-up boy was enough to try,Little Women
514,"the patience of a Boaz,"" complained Miss Malaprop, after several days",Little Women
514,"devoted to pleasure, fretting, and ennui.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"No one would own that they were tired of the experiment, but by Friday",Little Women
514,night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was,Little Women
514,"nearly done.  Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply, Mrs. March, who",Little Women
514,"had a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off the trial in an",Little Women
514,"appropriate manner, so she gave Hannah a holiday and let the girls",Little Women
514,enjoy the full effect of the play system.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"When they got up on Saturday morning, there was no fire in the kitchen,",Little Women
514,"no breakfast in the dining room, and no mother anywhere to be seen.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Mercy on us!  What has happened?"" cried Jo, staring about her in",Little Women
514,dismay.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg ran upstairs and soon came back again, looking relieved but rather",Little Women
514,"bewildered, and a little ashamed.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Mother isn't sick, only very tired, and she says she is going to stay",Little Women
514,quietly in her room all day and let us do the best we can.  It's a very,Little Women
514,"queer thing for her to do, she doesn't act a bit like herself.  But she",Little Women
514,"says it has been a hard week for her, so we mustn't grumble but take",Little Women
514,"care of ourselves.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That's easy enough, and I like the idea, I'm aching for something to",Little Women
514,"do, that is, some new amusement, you know,"" added Jo quickly.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"In fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work, and",Little Women
514,"they took hold with a will, but soon realized the truth of Hannah's",Little Women
514,"saying, ""Housekeeping ain't no joke.""  There was plenty of food in the",Little Women
514,"larder, and while Beth and Amy set the table, Meg and Jo got breakfast,",Little Women
514,wondering as they did why servants ever talked about hard work.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I shall take some up to Mother, though she said we were not to think",Little Women
514,"of her, for she'd take care of herself,"" said Meg, who presided and",Little Women
514,felt quite matronly behind the teapot.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"So a tray was fitted out before anyone began, and taken up with the",Little Women
514,"cook's compliments.  The boiled tea was very bitter, the omelet",Little Women
514,"scorched, and the biscuits speckled with saleratus, but Mrs. March",Little Women
514,received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after Jo,Little Women
514,was gone.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Poor little souls, they will have a hard time, I'm afraid, but they",Little Women
514,"won't suffer, and it will do them good,"" she said, producing the more",Little Women
514,"palatable viands with which she had provided herself, and disposing of",Little Women
514,"the bad breakfast, so that their feelings might not be hurt, a motherly",Little Women
514,little deception for which they were grateful.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Many were the complaints below, and great the chagrin of the head cook",Little Women
514,"at her failures.  ""Never mind, I'll get the dinner and be servant, you",Little Women
514,"be mistress, keep your hands nice, see company, and give orders,"" said",Little Women
514,"Jo, who knew still less than Meg about culinary affairs.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"This obliging offer was gladly accepted, and Margaret retired to the",Little Women
514,"parlor, which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter under the",Little Women
514,"sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble of dusting.  Jo, with",Little Women
514,perfect faith in her own powers and a friendly desire to make up the,Little Women
514,"quarrel, immediately put a note in the office, inviting Laurie to",Little Women
514,dinner.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You'd better see what you have got before you think of having",Little Women
514,"company,"" said Meg, when informed of the hospitable but rash act.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, there's corned beef and plenty of potatoes, and I shall get some",Little Women
514,"asparagus and a lobster, 'for a relish', as Hannah says. We'll have",Little Women
514,"lettuce and make a salad.  I don't know how, but the book tells.  I'll",Little Women
514,"have blanc mange and strawberries for dessert, and coffee too, if you",Little Women
514,"want to be elegant.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't try too many messes, Jo, for you can't make anything but",Little Women
514,gingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat.  I wash my hands of the,Little Women
514,"dinner party, and since you have asked Laurie on your own",Little Women
514,"responsibility, you may just take care of him.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I don't want you to do anything but be civil to him and help to the",Little Women
514,"pudding.  You'll give me your advice if I get in a muddle, won't you?""",Little Women
514,"asked Jo, rather hurt.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, but I don't know much, except about bread and a few trifles.  You",Little Women
514,"had better ask Mother's leave before you order anything,"" returned Meg",Little Women
514,prudently.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Of course I shall.  I'm not a fool.""  And Jo went off in a huff at the",Little Women
514,doubts expressed of her powers.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Get what you like, and don't disturb me.  I'm going out to dinner and",Little Women
514,"can't worry about things at home,"" said Mrs. March, when Jo spoke to",Little Women
514,"her.  ""I never enjoyed housekeeping, and I'm going to take a vacation",Little Women
514,"today, and read, write, go visiting, and amuse myself.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,The unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and,Little Women

514,eruption would hardly have seemed stranger.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Everything is out of sorts, somehow,"" she said to herself, going",Little Women
514,"downstairs.  ""There's Beth crying, that's a sure sign that something is",Little Women
514,"wrong in this family.  If Amy is bothering, I'll shake her.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Feeling very much out of sorts herself, Jo hurried into the parlor to",Little Women
514,"find Beth sobbing over Pip, the canary, who lay dead in the cage with",Little Women
514,"his little claws pathetically extended, as if imploring the food for",Little Women
514,want of which he had died.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's all my fault, I forgot him, there isn't a seed or a drop left.",Little Women
514,"Oh, Pip!  Oh, Pip!  How could I be so cruel to you?"" cried Beth, taking",Little Women
514,the poor thing in her hands and trying to restore him.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo peeped into his half-open eye, felt his little heart, and finding",Little Women
514,"him stiff and cold, shook her head, and offered her domino box for a",Little Women
514,coffin.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Put him in the oven, and maybe he will get warm and revive,"" said Amy",Little Women
514,hopefully.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""He's been starved, and he shan't be baked now he's dead.  I'll make",Little Women
514,"him a shroud, and he shall be buried in the garden, and I'll never have",Little Women
514,"another bird, never, my Pip! for I am too bad to own one,"" murmured",Little Women
514,"Beth, sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""The funeral shall be this afternoon, and we will all go.  Now, don't",Little Women
514,"cry, Bethy.  It's a pity, but nothing goes right this week, and Pip has",Little Women
514,"had the worst of the experiment.  Make the shroud, and lay him in my",Little Women
514,"box, and after the dinner party, we'll have a nice little funeral,""",Little Women
514,"said Jo, beginning to feel as if she had undertaken a good deal.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Leaving the others to console Beth, she departed to the kitchen, which",Little Women
514,"was in a most discouraging state of confusion.  Putting on a big apron,",Little Women
514,"she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for washing, when",Little Women
514,she discovered that the fire was out.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Here's a sweet prospect!"" muttered Jo, slamming the stove door open,",Little Women
514,and poking vigorously among the cinders.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Having rekindled the fire, she thought she would go to market while the",Little Women
514,"water heated.  The walk revived her spirits, and flattering herself",Little Women
514,"that she had made good bargains, she trudged home again, after buying a",Little Women
514,"very young lobster, some very old asparagus, and two boxes of acid",Little Women
514,"strawberries.  By the time she got cleared up, the dinner arrived and",Little Women
514,"the stove was red-hot.  Hannah had left a pan of bread to rise, Meg had",Little Women
514,"worked it up early, set it on the hearth for a second rising, and",Little Women
514,"forgotten it.  Meg was entertaining Sallie Gardiner in the parlor, when",Little Women
514,"the door flew open and a floury, crocky, flushed, and disheveled figure",Little Women
514,"appeared, demanding tartly...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I say, isn't bread 'riz' enough when it runs over the pans?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Sallie began to laugh, but Meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as high",Little Women
514,"as they would go, which caused the apparition to vanish and put the",Little Women
514,"sour bread into the oven without further delay.  Mrs. March went out,",Little Women
514,"after peeping here and there to see how matters went, also saying a",Little Women
514,"word of comfort to Beth, who sat making a winding sheet, while the dear",Little Women
514,departed lay in state in the domino box.  A strange sense of,Little Women
514,helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the,Little Women
514,"corner, and despair seized them when a few minutes later Miss Crocker",Little Women
514,"appeared, and said she'd come to dinner.  Now this lady was a thin,",Little Women
514,"yellow spinster, with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes, who saw",Little Women
514,"everything and gossiped about all she saw. They disliked her, but had",Little Women
514,"been taught to be kind to her, simply because she was old and poor and",Little Women
514,had few friends.  So Meg gave her the easy chair and tried to entertain,Little Women
514,"her, while she asked questions, criticized everything, and told stories",Little Women
514,of the people whom she knew.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Language cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and exertions",Little Women
514,"which Jo underwent that morning, and the dinner she served up became a",Little Women
514,"standing joke.  Fearing to ask any more advice, she did her best alone,",Little Women
514,and discovered that something more than energy and good will is,Little Women
514,necessary to make a cook.  She boiled the asparagus for an hour and was,Little Women
514,grieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever.,Little Women
514,The bread burned black; for the salad dressing so aggravated her that,Little Women
514,she could not make it fit to eat.  The lobster was a scarlet mystery to,Little Women
514,"her, but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meager",Little Women
514,proportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves.  The potatoes had,Little Women
514,"to be hurried, not to keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done at",Little Women
514,"the last.  The blanc mange was lumpy, and the strawberries not as ripe",Little Women
514,"as they looked, having been skilfully 'deaconed'.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, they can eat beef and bread and butter, if they are hungry, only",Little Women
514,"it's mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing,""",Little Women
514,"thought Jo, as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual, and",Little Women
514,"stood, hot, tired, and dispirited, surveying the feast spread before",Little Women
514,"Laurie, accustomed to all sorts of elegance, and Miss Crocker, whose",Little Women
514,tattling tongue would report them far and wide.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Poor Jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing after",Little Women
514,"another was tasted and left, while Amy giggled, Meg looked distressed,",Little Women
514,"Miss Crocker pursed her lips, and Laurie talked and laughed with all",Little Women
514,his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene.  Jo's one,Little Women
514,"strong point was the fruit, for she had sugared it well, and had a",Little Women
514,"pitcher of rich cream to eat with it.  Her hot cheeks cooled a trifle,",Little Women
514,"and she drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates went round, and",Little Women
514,everyone looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea,Little Women
514,"of cream.  Miss Crocker tasted first, made a wry face, and drank some",Little Women
514,"water hastily.  Jo, who refused, thinking there might not be enough,",Little Women
514,"for they dwindled sadly after the picking over, glanced at Laurie, but",Little Women
514,"he was eating away manfully, though there was a slight pucker about his",Little Women
514,"mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his plate.  Amy, who was fond of",Little Women
514,"delicate fare, took a heaping spoonful, choked, hid her face in her",Little Women
514,"napkin, and left the table precipitately.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, what is it?"" exclaimed Jo, trembling.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Salt instead of sugar, and the cream is sour,"" replied Meg with a",Little Women
514,tragic gesture.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair, remembering that she had",Little Women
514,given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes,Little Women
514,"on the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the milk in the",Little Women
514,"refrigerator.  She turned scarlet and was on the verge of crying, when",Little Women
514,"she met Laurie's eyes, which would look merry in spite of his heroic",Little Women
514,"efforts.  The comical side of the affair suddenly struck her, and she",Little Women
514,"laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks.  So did everyone else, even",Little Women
514,"'Croaker' as the girls called the old lady, and the unfortunate dinner",Little Women
514,"ended gaily, with bread and butter, olives and fun.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I haven't strength of mind enough to clear up now, so we will sober",Little Women
514,"ourselves with a funeral,"" said Jo, as they rose, and Miss Crocker made",Little Women
514,"ready to go, being eager to tell the new story at another friend's",Little Women
514,dinner table.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,They did sober themselves for Beth's sake.  Laurie dug a grave under,Little Women
514,"the ferns in the grove, little Pip was laid in, with many tears by his",Little Women
514,"tender-hearted mistress, and covered with moss, while a wreath of",Little Women
514,"violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph,",Little Women
514,composed by Jo while she struggled with the dinner.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"    Here lies Pip March,",Little Women
514,    Who died the 7th of June;,Little Women
514,"    Loved and lamented sore,",Little Women
514,    And not forgotten soon.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"At the conclusion of the ceremonies, Beth retired to her room, overcome",Little Women
514,"with emotion and lobster, but there was no place of repose, for the",Little Women
514,"beds were not made, and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up",Little Women
514,the pillows and putting things in order.  Meg helped Jo clear away the,Little Women
514,"remains of the feast, which took half the afternoon and left them so",Little Women
514,tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie took Amy to drive, which was a deed of charity, for the sour",Little Women
514,cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper.  Mrs. March came,Little Women
514,home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the,Little Women
514,"afternoon, and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success",Little Women
514,of one part of the experiment.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Before the housewives could rest, several people called, and there was",Little Women
514,"a scramble to get ready to see them.  Then tea must be got, errands",Little Women
514,"done, and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected until the last",Little Women
514,"minute.  As twilight fell, dewy and still, one by one they gathered on",Little Women
514,"the porch where the June roses were budding beautifully, and each",Little Women
514,"groaned or sighed as she sat down, as if tired or troubled.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What a dreadful day this has been!"" began Jo, usually the first to",Little Women
514,speak.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It has seemed shorter than usual, but so uncomfortable,"" said Meg.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not a bit like home,"" added Amy.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It can't seem so without Marmee and little Pip,"" sighed Beth, glancing",Little Women
514,with full eyes at the empty cage above her head.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Here's Mother, dear, and you shall have another bird tomorrow, if you",Little Women
514,"want it.""",Little Women

514,if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Are you satisfied with your experiment, girls, or do you want another",Little Women
514,"week of it?"" she asked, as Beth nestled up to her and the rest turned",Little Women
514,"toward her with brightening faces, as flowers turn toward the sun.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I don't!"" cried Jo decidedly.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Nor I,"" echoed the others.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You think then, that it is better to have a few duties and live a",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Lounging and larking doesn't pay,"" observed Jo, shaking her head. ""I'm",Little Women
514,"tired of it and mean to go to work at something right off.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Suppose you learn plain cooking.  That's a useful accomplishment,",Little Women
514,"which no woman should be without,"" said Mrs. March, laughing inaudibly",Little Women
514,"at the recollection of Jo's dinner party, for she had met Miss Crocker",Little Women
514,and heard her account of it.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Mother, did you go away and let everything be, just to see how we'd",Little Women
514,"get on?"" cried Meg, who had had suspicions all day.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing",Little Women
514,"her share faithfully.  While Hannah and I did your work, you got on",Little Women
514,"pretty well, though I don't think you were very happy or amiable.  So I",Little Women
514,"thought, as a little lesson, I would show you what happens when",Little Women
514,everyone thinks only of herself.  Don't you feel that it is pleasanter,Little Women
514,"to help one another, to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when",Little Women
514,"it comes, and to bear and forbear, that home may be comfortable and",Little Women
514,"lovely to us all?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""We do, Mother, we do!"" cried the girls.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again, for",Little Women
514,"though they seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and lighten as",Little Women
514,"we learn to carry them.  Work is wholesome, and there is plenty for",Little Women
514,"everyone.  It keeps us from ennui and mischief, is good for health and",Little Women

514,"""Very good!  Then I am quite satisfied with the experiment, and fancy",Little Women
514,"that we shall not have to repeat it, only don't go to the other extreme",Little Women
514,"and delve like slaves.  Have regular hours for work and play, make each",Little Women
514,"day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth",Little Women

514,"anointed her afflicted face with cold cream, Beth had taken Joanna to",Little Women
514,"bed with her to atone for the approaching separation, and Amy had",Little Women
514,capped the climax by putting a clothespin on her nose to uplift the,Little Women
514,offending feature.  It was one of the kind artists use to hold the,Little Women
514,"paper on their drawing boards, therefore quite appropriate and",Little Women
514,effective for the purpose it was now being put.  This funny spectacle,Little Women
514,"appeared to amuse the sun, for he burst out with such radiance that Jo",Little Women
514,woke up and roused her sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy's ornament.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party, and soon a",Little Women

514,frequent telegrams from the window.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""There goes the man with the tent!  I see Mrs. Barker doing up the",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""I just will, though, for it's capital, so shady, light, and big. It",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,Laurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the most cordial,Little Women
514,"manner.  The lawn was the reception room, and for several minutes a",Little Women
514,lively scene was enacted there.  Meg was grateful to see that Miss,Little Women
514,"Kate, though twenty, was dressed with a simplicity which American girls",Little Women
514,"would do well to imitate, and who was much flattered by Mr. Ned's",Little Women
514,assurances that he came especially to see her.  Jo understood why,Little Women
514,"Laurie 'primmed up his mouth' when speaking of Kate, for that young",Little Women
514,"lady had a standoff-don't-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly with",Little Women
514,the free and easy demeanor of the other girls.  Beth took an,Little Women
514,observation of the new boys and decided that the lame one was not,Little Women
514,"'dreadful', but gentle and feeble, and she would be kind to him on that",Little Women
514,"account.  Amy found Grace a well-mannered, merry, little person, and",Little Women
514,"after staring dumbly at one another for a few minutes, they suddenly",Little Women
514,became very good friends.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Tents, lunch, and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand, the",Little Women
514,"party was soon embarked, and the two boats pushed off together, leaving",Little Women
514,Mr. Laurence waving his hat on the shore.  Laurie and Jo rowed one,Little Women
514,"boat, Mr. Brooke and Ned the other, while Fred Vaughn, the riotous",Little Women
514,"twin, did his best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a",Little Women
514,"disturbed water bug.  Jo's funny hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it",Little Women
514,was of general utility.  It broke the ice in the beginning by producing,Little Women
514,"a laugh, it created quite a refreshing breeze, flapping to and fro as",Little Women
514,"she rowed, and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party, if",Little Women
514,"a shower came up, she said.  Miss Kate decided that she was 'odd', but",Little Women
514,"rather clever, and smiled upon her from afar.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face with",Little Women
514,"the rowers, who both admired the prospect and feathered their oars with",Little Women
514,"uncommon 'skill and dexterity'.  Mr. Brooke was a grave, silent young",Little Women
514,"man, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice.  Meg liked his",Little Women
514,quiet manners and considered him a walking encyclopedia of useful,Little Women
514,"knowledge.  He never talked to her much, but he looked at her a good",Little Women
514,"deal, and she felt sure that he did not regard her with aversion.  Ned,",Little Women
514,"being in college, of course put on all the airs which freshmen think it",Little Women
514,"their bounden duty to assume.  He was not very wise, but very",Little Women
514,"good-natured, and altogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic.",Little Women
514,Sallie Gardiner was absorbed in keeping her white pique dress clean and,Little Women

514,by his pranks.,Little Women

514,"before it gets hot, and then we'll see about dinner.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Frank, Beth, Amy, and Grace sat down to watch the game played by the",Little Women
514,"other eight.  Mr. Brooke chose Meg, Kate, and Fred. Laurie took Sallie,",Little Women
514,"Jo, and Ned.  The English played well, but the Americans played better,",Little Women
514,and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the spirit of,Little Women
514,'76 inspired them.  Jo and Fred had several skirmishes and once,Little Women
514,narrowly escaped high words. Jo was through the last wicket and had,Little Women
514,"missed the stroke, which failure ruffled her a good deal.  Fred was",Little Women
514,"close behind her and his turn came before hers.  He gave a stroke, his",Little Women
514,"ball hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong side.  No one was",Little Women
514,"very near, and running up to examine, he gave it a sly nudge with his",Little Women
514,"toe, which put it just an inch on the right side.",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Upon my word, I didn't move it.  It rolled a bit, perhaps, but that is",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""We don't cheat in America, but you can, if you choose,"" said Jo",Little Women

514,"colored up to her forehead and stood a minute, hammering down a wicket",Little Women
514,"with all her might, while Fred hit the stake and declared himself out",Little Women
514,"with much exultation.  She went off to get her ball, and was a long",Little Women
514,"time finding it among the bushes, but she came back, looking cool and",Little Women
514,"quiet, and waited her turn patiently.  It took several strokes to",Little Women
514,"regain the place she had lost, and when she got there, the other side",Little Women
514,"had nearly won, for Kate's ball was the last but one and lay near the",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie threw up his hat, then remembered that it wouldn't do to exult",Little Women
514,"over the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middle of the cheer",Little Women

514,"""Jo can,"" said Meg, glad to recommend her sister.  So Jo, feeling that",Little Women
514,"her late lessons in cookery were to do her honor, went to preside over",Little Women
514,"the coffeepot, while the children collected dry sticks, and the boys",Little Women
514,made a fire and got water from a spring near by.  Miss Kate sketched,Little Women
514,"and Frank talked to Beth, who was making little mats of braided rushes",Little Women
514,to serve as plates.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,The commander in chief and his aides soon spread the tablecloth with an,Little Women
514,"inviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily decorated with",Little Women
514,"green leaves.  Jo announced that the coffee was ready, and everyone",Little Women
514,"settled themselves to a hearty meal, for youth is seldom dyspeptic, and",Little Women
514,"exercise develops wholesome appetites. A very merry lunch it was, for",Little Women
514,"everything seemed fresh and funny, and frequent peals of laughter",Little Women
514,startled a venerable horse who fed near by.  There was a pleasing,Little Women
514,"inequality in the table, which produced many mishaps to cups and",Little Women
514,"plates, acorns dropped in the milk, little black ants partook of the",Little Women
514,"refreshments without being invited, and fuzzy caterpillars swung down",Little Women
514,from the tree to see what was going on.  Three white-headed children,Little Women
514,"peeped over the fence, and an objectionable dog barked at them from the",Little Women

514,"""I had an uncommonly good time that day, and haven't got over it yet.",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Miss Kate did know several new games, and as the girls would not, and",Little Women

514,"""Once on a time, a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune,",Little Women
514,for he had nothing but his sword and his shield. He traveled a long,Little Women

514,"he came to the palace of a good old king, who had offered a reward to",Little Women
514,"anyone who could tame and train a fine but unbroken colt, of which he",Little Women
514,"was very fond.  The knight agreed to try, and got on slowly but surely,",Little Women
514,"for the colt was a gallant fellow, and soon learned to love his new",Little Women
514,"master, though he was freakish and wild.  Every day, when he gave his",Little Women
514,"lessons to this pet of the king's, the knight rode him through the",Little Women
514,"city, and as he rode, he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful",Little Women
514,"face, which he had seen many times in his dreams, but never found.  One",Little Women
514,"day, as he went prancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window of a",Little Women
514,"ruinous castle the lovely face.  He was delighted, inquired who lived",Little Women
514,"in this old castle, and was told that several captive princesses were",Little Women
514,"kept there by a spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy their",Little Women
514,"liberty.  The knight wished intensely that he could free them, but he",Little Women
514,"was poor and could only go by each day, watching for the sweet face and",Little Women
514,longing to see it out in the sunshine.  At last he resolved to get into,Little Women
514,the castle and ask how he could help them.  He went and knocked.  The,Little Women
514,"great door flew open, and he beheld...""",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,here till my tyrant is destroyed.' 'Where is the villain?' 'In the,Little Women
514,"mauve salon.  Go, brave heart, and save me from despair.' 'I obey, and",Little Women

514,"locked, tore up the curtains, made a rope ladder, got halfway down when",Little Women

514,"your fist, and spiders that would frighten you into hysterics, Miss",Little Women

514,"knight in whom I'm interested went back to find the pretty face, and",Little Women

514,"the beauty of the sad scene, Meg read as if alone, giving a little",Little Women
514,touch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen.  If she had seen,Little Women

514,"Frank, sitting just behind the little girls, heard what they were",Little Women
514,"saying, and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient gesture",Little Women
514,as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical,Little Women
514,"gymnastics.  Beth, who was collecting the scattered Author cards,",Little Women
514,"looked up and said, in her shy yet friendly way, ""I'm afraid you are",Little Women
514,"tired.  Can I do anything for you?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Talk to me, please.  It's dull, sitting by myself,"" answered Frank,",Little Women

514,"more impossible task to bashful Beth, but there was no place to run to,",Little Women

514,that she bravely resolved to try.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What do you like to talk about?"" she asked, fumbling over the cards",Little Women
514,and dropping half as she tried to tie them up.,Little Women

514,innocent blunder.,Little Women

514,"Buffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory, and in her eagerness to",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,CASTLES IN THE AIR,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock one warm,Little Women
514,"September afternoon, wondering what his neighbors were about, but too",Little Women
514,"lazy to go and find out.  He was in one of his moods, for the day had",Little Women
514,"been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory, and he was wishing he could",Little Women
514,"live it over again.  The hot weather made him indolent, and he had",Little Women
514,"shirked his studies, tried Mr. Brooke's patience to the utmost,",Little Women
514,"displeased his grandfather by practicing half the afternoon, frightened",Little Women
514,the maidservants half out of their wits by mischievously hinting that,Little Women
514,"one of his dogs was going mad, and, after high words with the stableman",Little Women
514,"about some fancied neglect of his horse, he had flung himself into his",Little Women
514,"hammock to fume over the stupidity of the world in general, till the",Little Women
514,peace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself. Staring up,Little Women
514,"into the green gloom of the horse-chestnut trees above him, he dreamed",Little Women
514,"dreams of all sorts, and was just imagining himself tossing on the",Little Women
514,"ocean in a voyage round the world, when the sound of voices brought him",Little Women
514,"ashore in a flash. Peeping through the meshes of the hammock, he saw",Little Women
514,"the Marches coming out, as if bound on some expedition.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What in the world are those girls about now?"" thought Laurie, opening",Little Women
514,"his sleepy eyes to take a good look, for there was something rather",Little Women
514,"peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors.  Each wore a large,",Little Women
514,"flapping hat, a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder, and carried",Little Women
514,"a long staff.  Meg had a cushion, Jo a book, Beth a basket, and Amy a",Little Women
514,"portfolio.  All walked quietly through the garden, out at the little",Little Women
514,"back gate, and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and",Little Women
514,river.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, that's cool,"" said Laurie to himself, ""to have a picnic and",Little Women
514,"never ask me!  They can't be going in the boat, for they haven't got",Little Women
514,"the key.  Perhaps they forgot it.  I'll take it to them, and see what's",Little Women
514,"going on.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Though possessed of half a dozen hats, it took him some time to find",Little Women
514,"one, then there was a hunt for the key, which was at last discovered in",Little Women
514,"his pocket, so that the girls were quite out of sight when he leaped",Little Women
514,the fence and ran after them.  Taking the shortest way to the,Little Women
514,"boathouse, he waited for them to appear, but no one came, and he went",Little Women
514,up the hill to take an observation.  A grove of pines covered one part,Little Women
514,"of it, and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than",Little Women
514,the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Here's a landscape!"" thought Laurie, peeping through the bushes, and",Little Women
514,looking wide-awake and good-natured already.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It was a rather pretty little picture, for the sisters sat together in",Little Women
514,"the shady nook, with sun and shadow flickering over them, the aromatic",Little Women
514,"wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks, and all the",Little Women
514,little wood people going on with their affairs as if these were no,Little Women
514,"strangers but old friends.  Meg sat upon her cushion, sewing daintily",Little Women
514,"with her white hands, and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her",Little Women
514,pink dress among the green.  Beth was sorting the cones that lay thick,Little Women
514,"under the hemlock near by, for she made pretty things with them.  Amy",Little Women
514,"was sketching a group of ferns, and Jo was knitting as she read aloud.",Little Women
514,"A shadow passed over the boy's face as he watched them, feeling that he",Little Women
514,ought to go away because uninvited; yet lingering because home seemed,Little Women
514,very lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his,Little Women
514,"restless spirit.  He stood so still that a squirrel, busy with its",Little Women
514,"harvesting, ran down a pine close beside him, saw him suddenly and",Little Women
514,"skipped back, scolding so shrilly that Beth looked up, espied the",Little Women
514,"wistful face behind the birches, and beckoned with a reassuring smile.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""May I come in, please?  Or shall I be a bother?"" he asked, advancing",Little Women
514,slowly.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg lifted her eyebrows, but Jo scowled at her defiantly and said at",Little Women
514,"once, ""Of course you may.  We should have asked you before, only we",Little Women
514,"thought you wouldn't care for such a girl's game as this.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I always like your games, but if Meg doesn't want me, I'll go away.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I've no objection, if you do something.  It's against the rules to be",Little Women
514,"idle here,"" replied Meg gravely but graciously.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Much obliged.  I'll do anything if you'll let me stop a bit, for it's",Little Women
514,"as dull as the Desert of Sahara down there.  Shall I sew, read, cone,",Little Women
514,"draw, or do all at once? Bring on your bears. I'm ready.""  And Laurie",Little Women
514,sat down with a submissive expression delightful to behold.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Finish this story while I set my heel,"" said Jo, handing him the book.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes'm."" was the meek answer, as he began, doing his best to prove his",Little Women
514,gratitude for the favor of admission into the 'Busy Bee Society'.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The story was not a long one, and when it was finished, he ventured to",Little Women
514,ask a few questions as a reward of merit.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming",Little Women
514,"institution is a new one?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Would you tell him?"" asked Meg of her sisters.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""He'll laugh,"" said Amy warningly.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Who cares?"" said Jo.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I guess he'll like it,"" added Beth.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Of course I shall!  I give you my word I won't laugh.  Tell away, Jo,",Little Women
514,"and don't be afraid.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""The idea of being afraid of you!  Well, you see we used to play",Little Women
514,"Pilgrim's Progress, and we have been going on with it in earnest, all",Little Women
514,"winter and summer.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, I know,"" said Laurie, nodding wisely.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Who told you?"" demanded Jo.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Spirits.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, I did.  I wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away,",Little Women
514,"and he was rather dismal.  He did like it, so don't scold, Jo,"" said",Little Women
514,Beth meekly.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You can't keep a secret.  Never mind, it saves trouble now.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Go on, please,"" said Laurie, as Jo became absorbed in her work,",Little Women
514,looking a trifle displeased.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, didn't she tell you about this new plan of ours?  Well, we have",Little Women
514,"tried not to waste our holiday, but each has had a task and worked at",Little Women
514,"it with a will.  The vacation is nearly over, the stints are all done,",Little Women
514,"and we are ever so glad that we didn't dawdle.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, I should think so,"" and Laurie thought regretfully of his own",Little Women
514,idle days.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Mother likes to have us out-of-doors as much as possible, so we bring",Little Women
514,our work here and have nice times.  For the fun of it we bring our,Little Women
514,"things in these bags, wear the old hats, use poles to climb the hill,",Little Women
514,"and play pilgrims, as we used to do years ago.  We call this hill the",Little Women
514,"Delectable Mountain, for we can look far away and see the country where",Little Women
514,"we hope to live some time.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine, for through an opening in the",Little Women
514,"wood one could look cross the wide, blue river, the meadows on the",Little Women
514,"other side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to the green",Little Women
514,"hills that rose to meet the sky.  The sun was low, and the heavens",Little Women

514,"I'd rather be shot.  I hate tea and silk and spices, and every sort of",Little Women
514,"rubbish his old ships bring, and I don't care how soon they go to the",Little Women

514,I give him four years he ought to let me off from the business.  But,Little Women
514,"he's set, and I've got to do just as he did, unless I break away and",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie spoke excitedly, and looked ready to carry his threat into",Little Women
514,"execution on the slightest provocation, for he was growing up very fast",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""I advise you to sail away in one of your ships, and never come home",Little Women

514,"""That's not right, Jo.  You mustn't talk in that way, and Laurie",Little Women

514,"else to stay with and love him, and you'd never forgive yourself if you",Little Women
514,"left him without his permission.  Don't be dismal or fret, but do your",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Only what your grandpa told us about him, how he took good care of his",Little Women

514,"generous and patient and good as he can be.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""So he is, dear old fellow!"" said Laurie heartily, as Meg paused,",Little Women

514,"understand why your mother was so kind to him, asking him over with me",Little Women
514,and treating him in her beautiful friendly way.  He thought she was,Little Women
514,"just perfect, and talked about it for days and days, and went on about",Little Women

514,"same.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Bent on showing that he was not offended, he made himself as agreeable",Little Women
514,"as possible, wound cotton for Meg, recited poetry to please Jo, shook",Little Women
514,"down cones for Beth, and helped Amy with her ferns, proving himself a",Little Women
514,fit person to belong to the 'Busy Bee Society'.  In the midst of an,Little Women
514,animated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles (one of those,Little Women
514,"amiable creatures having strolled up from the river), the faint sound",Little Women

514,"writing busily, with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her,",Little Women
514,"while Scrabble, the pet rat, promenaded the beams overhead, accompanied",Little Women
514,"by his oldest son, a fine young fellow, who was evidently very proud of",Little Women
514,"his whiskers. Quite absorbed in her work, Jo scribbled away till the",Little Women
514,"last page was filled, when she signed her name with a flourish and",Little Women
514,"threw down her pen, exclaiming...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""There, I've done my best!  If this won't suit I shall have to wait",Little Women
514,"till I can do better.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Lying back on the sofa, she read the manuscript carefully through,",Little Women
514,"making dashes here and there, and putting in many exclamation points,",Little Women
514,which looked like little balloons.  Then she tied it up with a smart,Little Women
514,"red ribbon, and sat a minute looking at it with a sober, wistful",Little Women
514,"expression, which plainly showed how earnest her work had been.  Jo's",Little Women
514,desk up here was an old tin kitchen which hung against the wall.  In it,Little Women
514,"she kept her papers, and a few books, safely shut away from Scrabble,",Little Women
514,"who, being likewise of a literary turn, was fond of making a",Little Women
514,circulating library of such books as were left in his way by eating the,Little Women
514,"leaves.  From this tin receptacle Jo produced another manuscript, and",Little Women
514,"putting both in her pocket, crept quietly downstairs, leaving her",Little Women
514,friends to nibble on her pens and taste her ink.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and going to",Little Women
514,"the back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low porch, swung",Little Women
514,"herself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way to the road.",Little Women
514,"Once there, she composed herself, hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled",Little Women
514,"away to town, looking very merry and mysterious.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"If anyone had been watching her, he would have thought her movements",Little Women
514,"decidedly peculiar, for on alighting, she went off at a great pace till",Little Women
514,she reached a certain number in a certain busy street.  Having found,Little Women
514,"the place with some difficulty, she went into the doorway, looked up",Little Women
514,"the dirty stairs, and after standing stock still a minute, suddenly",Little Women
514,dived into the street and walked away as rapidly as she came.  This,Little Women
514,"maneuver she repeated several times, to the great amusement of a",Little Women
514,black-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building,Little Women
514,"opposite.  On returning for the third time, Jo gave herself a shake,",Little Women
514,"pulled her hat over her eyes, and walked up the stairs, looking as if",Little Women
514,she were going to have all her teeth out.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"There was a dentist's sign, among others, which adorned the entrance,",Little Women
514,and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly,Little Women

514,"gentleman put on his coat, took his hat, and went down to post himself",Little Women
514,"in the opposite doorway, saying with a smile and a shiver, ""It's like",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""What in the world are you doing here?"" she asked, regarding her",Little Women

514,"""Never till I'm stiff and old and have to use a crutch.  Don't try to",Little Women

514,surely come some time and now seemed very near.  He saw the trouble in,Little Women

514,"have you been calling, all so fine?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""At the Gardiners', and Sallie has been telling me all about Belle",Little Women

514,"""I shall never '_go_ and marry' anyone,"" observed Meg, walking on with",Little Women
514,"great dignity while the others followed, laughing, whispering, skipping",Little Women
514,"stones, and 'behaving like children', as Meg said to herself, though",Little Women
514,she might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best,Little Women
514,dress on.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"For a week or two, Jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were quite",Little Women
514,"bewildered.  She rushed to the door when the postman rang, was rude to",Little Women
514,"Mr. Brooke whenever they met, would sit looking at Meg with a",Little Women
514,"woe-begone face, occasionally jumping up to shake and then kiss her in",Little Women
514,a very mysterious manner.  Laurie and she were always making signs to,Little Women
514,"one another, and talking about 'Spread Eagles' till the girls declared",Little Women
514,they had both lost their wits.  On the second Saturday after Jo got out,Little Women
514,"of the window, Meg, as she sat sewing at her window, was scandalized by",Little Women
514,the sight of Laurie chasing Jo all over the garden and finally,Little Women
514,"capturing her in Amy's bower.  What went on there, Meg could not see,",Little Women
514,"but shrieks of laughter were heard, followed by the murmur of voices",Little Women
514,and a great flapping of newspapers.,Little Women

514,"""What shall we do with that girl?  She never _will_ behave like a young",Little Women

514,with anyone but her.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's very trying, but we never can make her _commy la fo_,"" added Amy,",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""That sounds well.  Read it,"" said Meg.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"With a loud ""Hem!"" and a long breath, Jo began to read very fast.  The",Little Women
514,"girls listened with interest, for the tale was romantic, and somewhat",Little Women
514,"pathetic, as most of the characters died in the end. ""I like that about",Little Women
514,"the splendid picture,"" was Amy's approving remark, as Jo paused.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I prefer the lovering part.  Viola and Angelo are two of our favorite",Little Women

514,"of the story, and offered hints for a sequel, which unfortunately",Little Women
514,"couldn't be carried out, as the hero and heroine were dead.  How Beth",Little Women
514,"got excited, and skipped and sang with joy.  How Hannah came in to",Little Women
514,"exclaim, ""Sakes alive, well I never!"" in great astonishment at 'that",Little Women
514,Jo's doin's'.  How proud Mrs. March was when she knew it.  How Jo,Little Women
514,"laughed, with tears in her eyes, as she declared she might as well be a",Little Women
514,"peacock and done with it, and how the 'Spread Eagle' might be said to",Little Women
514,"flap his wings triumphantly over the House of March, as the paper",Little Women

514,"comforted her very much.  There was nothing he didn't offer, from his",Little Women

514,Mrs. March would not hear of the old gentleman's undertaking the long,Little Women

514,"through the entry, with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea",Little Women
514,"in the other, she came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm very sorry to hear of this, Miss March,"" he said, in the kind,",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Down dropped the rubbers, and the tea was very near following, as Meg",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Meg spoke earnestly, and forgot herself entirely till something in the",Little Women

514,Everything was arranged by the time Laurie returned with a note from,Little Women

514,"she had often said before, that she had always told them it was absurd",Little Women
514,"for March to go into the army, always predicted that no good would come",Little Women
514,"of it, and she hoped they would take her advice the next time.  Mrs.",Little Women
514,"March put the note in the fire, the money in her purse, and went on",Little Women
514,"with her preparations, with her lips folded tightly in a way which Jo",Little Women
514,would have understood if she had been there.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The short afternoon wore away.  All other errands were done, and Meg",Little Women
514,"and her mother busy at some necessary needlework, while Beth and Amy",Little Women
514,"got tea, and Hannah finished her ironing with what she called a 'slap",Little Women
514,"and a bang', but still Jo did not come.  They began to get anxious, and",Little Women
514,"Laurie went off to find her, for no one knew what freak Jo might take",Little Women
514,"into her head.  He missed her, however, and she came walking in with a",Little Women
514,"very queer expression of countenance, for there was a mixture of fun",Little Women
514,"and fear, satisfaction and regret in it, which puzzled the family as",Little Women
514,"much as did the roll of bills she laid before her mother, saying with a",Little Women
514,"little choke in her voice, ""That's my contribution toward making Father",Little Women
514,"comfortable and bringing him home!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""My dear, where did you get it?  Twenty-five dollars!  Jo, I hope you",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet, and a general outcry arose, for",Little Women

514,"it, ""It doesn't affect the fate of the nation, so don't wail, Beth.  It",Little Women
514,"will be good for my vanity, I was getting too proud of my wig.  It will",Little Women
514,do my brains good to have that mop taken off.  My head feels,Little Women
514,"deliciously light and cool, and the barber said I could soon have a",Little Women

514,"you will regret it one of these days,"" said Mrs. March.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, I won't!"" returned Jo stoutly, feeling much relieved that her",Little Women
514,prank was not entirely condemned.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What made you do it?"" asked Amy, who would as soon have thought of",Little Women
514,cutting off her head as her pretty hair.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, I was wild to do something for Father,"" replied Jo, as they",Little Women
514,"gathered about the table, for healthy young people can eat even in the",Little Women
514,"midst of trouble.  ""I hate to borrow as much as Mother does, and I knew",Little Women
514,"Aunt March would croak, she always does, if you ask for a ninepence.",Little Women
514,"Meg gave all her quarterly salary toward the rent, and I only got some",Little Women
514,"clothes with mine, so I felt wicked, and was bound to have some money,",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""You needn't feel wicked, my child! You had no winter things and got",Little Women

514,"along I kept thinking what I could do, and feeling as if I'd like to",Little Women
514,dive into some of the rich stores and help myself.  In a barber's,Little Women
514,"window I saw tails of hair with the prices marked, and one black tail,",Little Women
514,"not so thick as mine, was forty dollars.  It came to me all of a sudden",Little Women
514,"that I had one thing to make money out of, and without stopping to",Little Women
514,"think, I walked in, asked if they bought hair, and what they would give",Little Women
514,"for mine.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I don't see how you dared to do it,"" said Beth in a tone of awe.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil his",Little Women

514,"care about mine, it wasn't the fashionable color, and he never paid",Little Women
514,"much for it in the first place.  The work put into it made it dear, and",Little Women
514,"so on.  It was getting late, and I was afraid if it wasn't done right",Little Women
514,"away that I shouldn't have it done at all, and you know when I start to",Little Women
514,"do a thing, I hate to give it up.  So I begged him to take it, and told",Little Women

514,"changed his mind, for I got rather excited, and told the story in my",Little Women

514,"confess, though, I felt queer when I saw the dear old hair laid out on",Little Women
514,"the table, and felt only the short rough ends of my head. It almost",Little Women
514,"seemed as if I'd an arm or leg off.  The woman saw me look at it, and",Little Women

514,"as they dressed, they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully and hopefully,",Little Women
514,and send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or,Little Women

514,"down, so dim and still outside, so full of light and bustle within.",Little Women
514,"Breakfast at that early hour seemed odd, and even Hannah's familiar",Little Women

514,"lay on the sofa, and Mother herself sat trying to eat, but looking so",Little Women

514,"the head of the family, Meg insisted on reading the dispatches, which",Little Women
514,"grew more cheerful as the week passed.  At first, everyone was eager to",Little Women

514,"The girls are all as good as gold.  Jo helps me with the sewing, and",Little Women

514,"could only cry, and say, ""I'm glad!  I'm glad!"" Didn't that do as well",Little Women
514,as a regular prayer?  For I felt a great many in my heart.  We have,Little Women
514,"such funny times, and now I can enjoy them, for everyone is so",Little Women
514,"desperately good, it's like living in a nest of turtledoves.  You'd",Little Women

514,For a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have supplied,Little Women
514,"the neighborhood.  It was really amazing, for everyone seemed in a",Little Women
514,"heavenly frame of mind, and self-denial was all the fashion.  Relieved",Little Women
514,"of their first anxiety about their father, the girls insensibly relaxed",Little Women
514,"their praiseworthy efforts a little, and began to fall back into old",Little Women
514,"ways.  They did not forget their motto, but hoping and keeping busy",Little Women
514,"seemed to grow easier, and after such tremendous exertions, they felt",Little Women
514,"that Endeavor deserved a holiday, and gave it a good many.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough,",Little Women
514,"and was ordered to stay at home till she was better, for Aunt March",Little Women
514,didn't like to hear people read with colds in their heads.  Jo liked,Little Women
514,"this, and after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar, subsided on",Little Women
514,the sofa to nurse her cold with arsenicum and books.  Amy found that,Little Women
514,"housework and art did not go well together, and returned to her mud",Little Women
514,"pies.  Meg went daily to her pupils, and sewed, or thought she did, at",Little Women
514,"home, but much time was spent in writing long letters to her mother, or",Little Women
514,"reading the Washington dispatches over and over.  Beth kept on, with",Little Women
514,only slight relapses into idleness or grieving.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"All the little duties were faithfully done each day, and many of her",Little Women
514,"sisters' also, for they were forgetful, and the house seemed like a",Little Women
514,clock whose pendulum was gone a-visiting.  When her heart got heavy,Little Women
514,"with longings for Mother or fears for Father, she went away into a",Little Women
514,"certain closet, hid her face in the folds of a dear old gown, and made",Little Women
514,her little moan and prayed her little prayer quietly by herself.,Little Women
514,"Nobody knew what cheered her up after a sober fit, but everyone felt",Little Women
514,"how sweet and helpful Beth was, and fell into a way of going to her for",Little Women
514,comfort or advice in their small affairs.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"All were unconscious that this experience was a test of character, and",Little Women
514,"when the first excitement was over, felt that they had done well and",Little Women

514,"well, and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret.",Little Women

514,"put on her hood, filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor",Little Women

514,no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into her mother's room.,Little Women
514,"Half an hour after, Jo went to 'Mother's closet' for something, and",Little Women

514,,Little Women

514,"let Lotty rest.  It seemed asleep, but all of a sudden if gave a little",Little Women
514,"cry and trembled, and then lay very still. I tried to warm its feet,",Little Women
514,"and Lotty gave it some milk, but it didn't stir, and I knew it was",Little Women

514,"said crossly.  Mrs. Hummel told him she was poor, and had tried to cure",Little Women
514,"baby herself, but now it was too late, and she could only ask him to",Little Women
514,"help the others and trust to charity for his pay.  He smiled then, and",Little Women
514,"was kinder, but it was very sad, and I cried with them till he turned",Little Women
514,"round all of a sudden, and told me to go home and take belladonna right",Little Women
514,"away, or I'd have the fever.""",Little Women

514,"and questioned Beth, ""we will have Dr. Bangs, just to take a look at",Little Women
514,"you, dear, and see that we start right.  Then we'll send Amy off to",Little Women
514,"Aunt March's for a spell, to keep her out of harm's way, and one of you",Little Women

514,"contented look, which effectually settled that point.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll go and tell Amy,"" said Meg, feeling a little hurt, yet rather",Little Women
514,"relieved on the whole, for she did not like nursing, and Jo did.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Amy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she had rather",Little Women
514,"have the fever than go to Aunt March.  Meg reasoned, pleaded, and",Little Women
514,"commanded, all in vain.  Amy protested that she would not go, and Meg",Little Women
514,left her in despair to ask Hannah what should be done.  Before she came,Little Women
514,"back, Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy sobbing, with her head",Little Women
514,"in the sofa cushions.  She told her story, expecting to be consoled,",Little Women
514,"but Laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room,",Little Women
514,"whistling softly, as he knit his brows in deep thought.  Presently he",Little Women
514,"sat down beside her, and said, in his most wheedlesome tone, ""Now be a",Little Women
514,"sensible little woman, and do as they say. No, don't cry, but hear what",Little Women
514,"a jolly plan I've got.  You go to Aunt March's, and I'll come and take",Little Women

514,DARK DAYS,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Beth did have the fever, and was much sicker than anyone but Hannah and",Little Women
514,"the doctor suspected.  The girls knew nothing about illness, and Mr.",Little Women
514,"Laurence was not allowed to see her, so Hannah had everything her own",Little Women
514,"way, and busy Dr. Bangs did his best, but left a good deal to the",Little Women
514,"excellent nurse.  Meg stayed at home, lest she should infect the Kings,",Little Women
514,"and kept house, feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote",Little Women
514,letters in which no mention was made of Beth's illness.  She could not,Little Women
514,"think it right to deceive her mother, but she had been bidden to mind",Little Women
514,"Hannah, and Hannah wouldn't hear of 'Mrs. March bein' told, and worried",Little Women
514,just for sech a trifle.',Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night, not a hard task, for Beth was",Little Women
514,"very patient, and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as she could",Little Women
514,control herself.  But there came a time when during the fever fits she,Little Women
514,"began to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on the coverlet as if",Little Women
514,"on her beloved little piano, and try to sing with a throat so swollen",Little Women
514,"that there was no music left, a time when she did not know the familiar",Little Women
514,"faces around her, but addressed them by wrong names, and called",Little Women
514,"imploringly for her mother.  Then Jo grew frightened, Meg begged to be",Little Women
514,"allowed to write the truth, and even Hannah said she 'would think of",Little Women
514,"it, though there was no danger yet'.  A letter from Washington added to",Little Women
514,"their trouble, for Mr. March had had a relapse, and could not think of",Little Women
514,coming home for a long while.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"How dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house, and how",Little Women
514,"heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited, while",Little Women
514,the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home. Then it was that,Little Women
514,"Margaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work, felt how",Little Women
514,rich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could,Little Women
514,"buy--in love, protection, peace, and health, the real blessings of",Little Women
514,"life.  Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened room, with that",Little Women
514,suffering little sister always before her eyes and that pathetic voice,Little Women
514,"sounding in her ears, learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of",Little Women
514,"Beth's nature, to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all",Little Women
514,"hearts, and to acknowledge the worth of Beth's unselfish ambition to",Little Women
514,"live for others, and make home happy by that exercise of those simple",Little Women
514,"virtues which all may possess, and which all should love and value more",Little Women
514,"than talent, wealth, or beauty.  And Amy, in her exile, longed eagerly",Little Women
514,"to be at home, that she might work for Beth, feeling now that no",Little Women
514,"service would be hard or irksome, and remembering, with regretful",Little Women
514,"grief, how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her.",Little Women
514,"Laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence locked",Little Women
514,"the grand piano, because he could not bear to be reminded of the young",Little Women
514,neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him.  Everyone,Little Women
514,"missed Beth.  The milkman, baker, grocer, and butcher inquired how she",Little Women
514,"did, poor Mrs. Hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness and to",Little Women
514,"get a shroud for Minna, the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and",Little Women
514,"good wishes, and even those who knew her best were surprised to find",Little Women
514,how many friends shy little Beth had made.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side, for even in",Little Women
514,her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege.  She longed for,Little Women
514,"her cats, but would not have them brought, lest they should get sick,",Little Women
514,and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety about Jo.  She sent,Little Women
514,"loving messages to Amy, bade them tell her mother that she would write",Little Women
514,"soon, and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word, that",Little Women
514,Father might not think she had neglected him. But soon even these,Little Women
514,"intervals of consciousness ended, and she lay hour after hour, tossing",Little Women
514,"to and fro, with incoherent words on her lips, or sank into a heavy",Little Women
514,"sleep which brought her no refreshment. Dr. Bangs came twice a day,",Little Women
514,"Hannah sat up at night, Meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to",Little Women
514,"send off at any minute, and Jo never stirred from Beth's side.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a bitter",Little Women
514,"wind blew, snow fell fast, and the year seemed getting ready for its",Little Women
514,"death.  When Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long at Beth, held",Little Women
514,"the hot hand in both his own for a minute, and laid it gently down,",Little Women
514,"saying, in a low voice to Hannah, ""If Mrs. March can leave her husband",Little Women
514,"she'd better be sent for.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Hannah nodded without speaking, for her lips twitched nervously, Meg",Little Women
514,dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs,Little Women
514,"at the sound of those words, and Jo, standing with a pale face for a",Little Women
514,"minute, ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, and throwing on",Little Women
514,"her things, rushed out into the storm.  She was soon back, and while",Little Women
514,"noiselessly taking off her cloak, Laurie came in with a letter, saying",Little Women
514,"that Mr. March was mending again.  Jo read it thankfully, but the heavy",Little Women
514,"weight did not seem lifted off her heart, and her face was so full of",Little Women
514,"misery that Laurie asked quickly, ""What is it?  Is Beth worse?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I've sent for Mother,"" said Jo, tugging at her rubber boots with a",Little Women
514,tragic expression.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Good for you, Jo!  Did you do it on your own responsibility?"" asked",Little Women
514,"Laurie, as he seated her in the hall chair and took off the rebellious",Little Women
514,"boots, seeing how her hands shook.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No.  The doctor told us to.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, Jo, it's not so bad as that?"" cried Laurie, with a startled face.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, it is.  She doesn't know us, she doesn't even talk about the",Little Women
514,"flocks of green doves, as she calls the vine leaves on the wall. She",Little Women
514,"doesn't look like my Beth, and there's nobody to help us bear it.",Little Women
514,"Mother and father both gone, and God seems so far away I can't find",Little Women
514,"Him.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As the tears streamed fast down poor Jo's cheeks, she stretched out her",Little Women
514,"hand in a helpless sort of way, as if groping in the dark, and Laurie",Little Women
514,"took it in his, whispering as well as he could with a lump in his",Little Women
514,"throat, ""I'm here.  Hold on to me, Jo, dear!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She could not speak, but she did 'hold on', and the warm grasp of the",Little Women
514,"friendly human hand comforted her sore heart, and seemed to lead her",Little Women
514,nearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her in her trouble.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable, but no fitting",Little Women
514,"words came to him, so he stood silent, gently stroking her bent head as",Little Women
514,"her mother used to do.  It was the best thing he could have done, far",Little Women
514,"more soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo felt the unspoken",Little Women
514,"sympathy, and in the silence learned the sweet solace which affection",Little Women
514,administers to sorrow.  Soon she dried the tears which had relieved,Little Women
514,"her, and looked up with a grateful face.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Thank you, Teddy, I'm better now.  I don't feel so forlorn, and will",Little Women
514,"try to bear it if it comes.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Keep hoping for the best, that will help you, Jo.  Soon your mother",Little Women
514,"will be here, and then everything will be all right.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm so glad Father is better.  Now she won't feel so bad about leaving",Little Women
514,"him.  Oh, me!  It does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap, and",Little Women
514,"I got the heaviest part on my shoulders,"" sighed Jo, spreading her wet",Little Women
514,handkerchief over her knees to dry.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Doesn't Meg pull fair?"" asked Laurie, looking indignant.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, yes, she tries to, but she can't love Bethy as I do, and she won't",Little Women
514,"miss her as I shall.  Beth is my conscience, and I can't give her up.",Little Women
514,"I can't!  I can't!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Down went Jo's face into the wet handkerchief, and she cried",Little Women
514,"despairingly, for she had kept up bravely till now and never shed a",Little Women
514,"tear.  Laurie drew his hand across his eyes, but could not speak till",Little Women
514,he had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips.,Little Women
514,"It might be unmanly, but he couldn't help it, and I am glad of it.",Little Women
514,"Presently, as Jo's sobs quieted, he said hopefully, ""I don't think she",Little Women
514,"will die.  She's so good, and we all love her so much, I don't believe",Little Women
514,"God will take her away yet.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""The good and dear people always do die,"" groaned Jo, but she stopped",Little Women
514,"crying, for her friend's words cheered her up in spite of her own",Little Women
514,doubts and fears.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Poor girl, you're worn out.  It isn't like you to be forlorn. Stop a",Little Women
514,"bit.  I'll hearten you up in a jiffy.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie went off two stairs at a time, and Jo laid her wearied head down",Little Women
514,"on Beth's little brown hood, which no one had thought of moving from",Little Women
514,"the table where she left it.  It must have possessed some magic, for",Little Women
514,"the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into Jo, and",Little Women
514,"when Laurie came running down with a glass of wine, she took it with a",Little Women
514,"smile, and said bravely, ""I drink-- Health to my Beth!  You are a good",Little Women
514,"doctor, Teddy, and such a comfortable friend.  How can I ever pay you?""",Little Women
514,"she added, as the wine refreshed her body, as the kind words had done",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll send my bill, by-and-by, and tonight I'll give you something that",Little Women
514,"will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine,"" said",Little Women
514,"Laurie, beaming at her with a face of suppressed satisfaction at",Little Women
514,something.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What is it?"" cried Jo, forgetting her woes for a minute in her wonder.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I telegraphed to your mother yesterday, and Brooke answered she'd come",Little Women

514,"Aren't you glad I did it?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie spoke very fast, and turned red and excited all in a minute, for",Little Women
514,"he had kept his plot a secret, for fear of disappointing the girls or",Little Women
514,"harming Beth.  Jo grew quite white, flew out of her chair, and the",Little Women
514,moment he stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing her arms,Little Women
514,"round his neck, and crying out, with a joyful cry, ""Oh, Laurie!  Oh,",Little Women
514,"Mother!  I am so glad!""  She did not weep again, but laughed",Little Women
514,"hysterically, and trembled and clung to her friend as if she was a",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great presence of mind.",Little Women
514,"He patted her back soothingly, and finding that she was recovering,",Little Women
514,"followed it up by a bashful kiss or two, which brought Jo round at",Little Women
514,"once.  Holding on to the banisters, she put him gently away, saying",Little Women
514,"breathlessly, ""Oh, don't!  I didn't mean to, it was dreadful of me, but",Little Women
514,you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of Hannah that I couldn't,Little Women

514,,Little Women

514,"to say it was high time we did something, and off I pelted to the",Little Women

514,"""That's the interferingest chap I ever see, but I forgive him and do",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Meg had a quiet rapture, and then brooded over the letter, while Jo set",Little Women
514,"the sickroom in order, and Hannah ""knocked up a couple of pies in case",Little Women
514,"of company unexpected"".  A breath of fresh air seemed to blow through",Little Women
514,"the house, and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet",Little Women
514,rooms.  Everything appeared to feel the hopeful change.  Beth's bird,Little Women
514,"began to chirp again, and a half-blown rose was discovered on Amy's",Little Women
514,"bush in the window. The fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness,",Little Women
514,"and every time the girls met, their pale faces broke into smiles as",Little Women
514,"they hugged one another, whispering encouragingly, ""Mother's coming,",Little Women
514,"dear! Mother's coming!""  Every one rejoiced but Beth.  She lay in that",Little Women
514,"heavy stupor, alike unconscious of hope and joy, doubt and danger. It",Little Women
514,"was a piteous sight, the once rosy face so changed and vacant, the once",Little Women
514,"busy hands so weak and wasted, the once smiling lips quite dumb, and",Little Women
514,"the once pretty, well-kept hair scattered rough and tangled on the",Little Women
514,"pillow.  All day she lay so, only rousing now and then to mutter,",Little Women
514,"""Water!"" with lips so parched they could hardly shape the word.  All",Little Women
514,"day Jo and Meg hovered over her, watching, waiting, hoping, and",Little Women
514,"trusting in God and Mother, and all day the snow fell, the bitter wind",Little Women
514,"raged, and the hours dragged slowly by.  But night came at last, and",Little Women
514,"every time the clock struck, the sisters, still sitting on either side",Little Women
514,"of the bed, looked at each other with brightening eyes, for each hour",Little Women
514,"brought help nearer.  The doctor had been in to say that some change,",Little Women
514,"for better or worse, would probably take place about midnight, at which",Little Women
514,time he would return.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Hannah, quite worn out, lay down on the sofa at the bed's foot and fell",Little Women
514,"fast asleep, Mr. Laurence marched to and fro in the parlor, feeling",Little Women
514,that he would rather face a rebel battery than Mrs. March's countenance,Little Women
514,"as she entered.  Laurie lay on the rug, pretending to rest, but staring",Little Women
514,into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black eyes,Little Women
514,beautifully soft and clear.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The girls never forgot that night, for no sleep came to them as they",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Here the clock struck twelve, and both forgot themselves in watching",Little Women
514,"Beth, for they fancied a change passed over her wan face. The house was",Little Women
514,"still as death, and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep",Little Women
514,"hush.  Weary Hannah slept on, and no one but the sisters saw the pale",Little Women
514,"shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed.  An hour went by, and",Little Women
514,nothing happened except Laurie's quiet departure for the station.,Little Women
514,"Another hour, still no one came, and anxious fears of delay in the",Little Women

514,"It was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking how dreary",Little Women
514,"the world looked in its winding sheet of snow, heard a movement by the",Little Women
514,"bed, and turning quickly, saw Meg kneeling before their mother's easy",Little Women
514,"chair with her face hidden.  A dreadful fear passed coldly over Jo, as",Little Women
514,"she thought, ""Beth is dead, and Meg is afraid to tell me.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She was back at her post in an instant, and to her excited eyes a great",Little Women
514,change seemed to have taken place.  The fever flush and the look of,Little Women
514,"pain were gone, and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful",Little Women
514,in its utter repose that Jo felt no desire to weep or to lament.,Little Women
514,"Leaning low over this dearest of her sisters, she kissed the damp",Little Women
514,"forehead with her heart on her lips, and softly whispered, ""Good-by, my",Little Women
514,"Beth.  Good-by!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As if awaked by the stir, Hannah started out of her sleep, hurried to",Little Women
514,"the bed, looked at Beth, felt her hands, listened at her lips, and",Little Women
514,"then, throwing her apron over her head, sat down to rock to and fro,",Little Women
514,"exclaiming, under her breath, ""The fever's turned, she's sleepin'",Little Women

514,"my goodness me!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Before the girls could believe the happy truth, the doctor came to",Little Women
514,"confirm it.  He was a homely man, but they thought his face quite",Little Women
514,"heavenly when he smiled and said, with a fatherly look at them, ""Yes,",Little Women

514,"What they were to give, neither heard, for both crept into the dark",Little Women
514,"hall, and, sitting on the stairs, held each other close, rejoicing with",Little Women
514,hearts too full for words.  When they went back to be kissed and,Little Women
514,"cuddled by faithful Hannah, they found Beth lying, as she used to do,",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,AMY'S WILL,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"While these things were happening at home, Amy was having hard times at",Little Women
514,"Aunt March's.  She felt her exile deeply, and for the first time in her",Little Women
514,"life, realized how much she was beloved and petted at home.  Aunt March",Little Women
514,"never petted any one; she did not approve of it, but she meant to be",Little Women
514,"kind, for the well-behaved little girl pleased her very much, and Aunt",Little Women
514,"March had a soft place in her old heart for her nephew's children,",Little Women
514,though she didn't think it proper to confess it.  She really did her,Little Women
514,"best to make Amy happy, but, dear me, what mistakes she made. Some old",Little Women
514,"people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs, can",Little Women
514,"sympathize with children's little cares and joys, make them feel at",Little Women
514,"home, and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays, giving and",Little Women
514,receiving friendship in the sweetest way.  But Aunt March had not this,Little Women
514,"gift, and she worried Amy very much with her rules and orders, her prim",Little Women
514,"ways, and long, prosy talks.  Finding the child more docile and amiable",Little Women
514,"than her sister, the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract,",Little Women
514,"as far as possible, the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence.  So",Little Women
514,"she took Amy by the hand, and taught her as she herself had been taught",Little Women
514,"sixty years ago, a process which carried dismay to Amy's soul, and made",Little Women
514,her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She had to wash the cups every morning, and polish up the old-fashioned",Little Women
514,"spoons, the fat silver teapot, and the glasses till they shone.  Then",Little Women
514,"she must dust the room, and what a trying job that was.  Not a speck",Little Women
514,"escaped Aunt March's eye, and all the furniture had claw legs and much",Little Women
514,"carving, which was never dusted to suit.  Then Polly had to be fed, the",Little Women
514,"lap dog combed, and a dozen trips upstairs and down to get things or",Little Women
514,"deliver orders, for the old lady was very lame and seldom left her big",Little Women
514,"chair.  After these tiresome labors, she must do her lessons, which was",Little Women
514,a daily trial of every virtue she possessed.  Then she was allowed one,Little Women
514,"hour for exercise or play, and didn't she enjoy it?",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie came every day, and wheedled Aunt March till Amy was allowed to",Little Women
514,"go out with him, when they walked and rode and had capital times.",Little Women
514,"After dinner, she had to read aloud, and sit still while the old lady",Little Women
514,"slept, which she usually did for an hour, as she dropped off over the",Little Women
514,"first page.  Then patchwork or towels appeared, and Amy sewed with",Little Women
514,"outward meekness and inward rebellion till dusk, when she was allowed",Little Women
514,to amuse herself as she liked till teatime.  The evenings were the,Little Women
514,"worst of all, for Aunt March fell to telling long stories about her",Little Women
514,"youth, which were so unutterably dull that Amy was always ready to go",Little Women
514,"to bed, intending to cry over her hard fate, but usually going to sleep",Little Women
514,before she had squeezed out more than a tear or two.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"If it had not been for Laurie, and old Esther, the maid, she felt that",Little Women
514,she never could have got through that dreadful time.  The parrot alone,Little Women
514,"was enough to drive her distracted, for he soon felt that she did not",Little Women
514,"admire him, and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible.",Little Women
514,"He pulled her hair whenever she came near him, upset his bread and milk",Little Women
514,"to plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage, made Mop bark by",Little Women
514,"pecking at him while Madam dozed, called her names before company, and",Little Women
514,behaved in all respects like an reprehensible old bird.  Then she could,Little Women
514,"not endure the dog, a fat, cross beast who snarled and yelped at her",Little Women
514,"when she made his toilet, and who lay on his back with all his legs in",Little Women
514,the air and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted,Little Women
514,"something to eat, which was about a dozen times a day.  The cook was",Little Women
514,"bad-tempered, the old coachman was deaf, and Esther the only one who",Little Women
514,ever took any notice of the young lady.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Esther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with 'Madame', as she called her",Little Women
514,"mistress, for many years, and who rather tyrannized over the old lady,",Little Women
514,"who could not get along without her. Her real name was Estelle, but",Little Women
514,"Aunt March ordered her to change it, and she obeyed, on condition that",Little Women
514,she was never asked to change her religion.  She took a fancy to,Little Women
514,"Mademoiselle, and amused her very much with odd stories of her life in",Little Women
514,"France, when Amy sat with her while she got up Madame's laces.  She",Little Women
514,"also allowed her to roam about the great house, and examine the curious",Little Women
514,and pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient,Little Women
514,"chests, for Aunt March hoarded like a magpie.  Amy's chief delight was",Little Women
514,"an Indian cabinet, full of queer drawers, little pigeonholes, and",Little Women
514,"secret places, in which were kept all sorts of ornaments, some",Little Women
514,"precious, some merely curious, all more or less antique. To examine and",Little Women
514,"arrange these things gave Amy great satisfaction, especially the jewel",Little Women
514,"cases, in which on velvet cushions reposed the ornaments which had",Little Women
514,adorned a belle forty years ago.  There was the garnet set which Aunt,Little Women
514,"March wore when she came out, the pearls her father gave her on her",Little Women
514,"wedding day, her lover's diamonds, the jet mourning rings and pins, the",Little Women
514,"queer lockets, with portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made",Little Women
514,"of hair inside, the baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn,",Little Women
514,"Uncle March's big watch, with the red seal so many childish hands had",Little Women
514,"played with, and in a box all by itself lay Aunt March's wedding ring,",Little Women
514,"too small now for her fat finger, but put carefully away like the most",Little Women
514,precious jewel of them all.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Which would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will?"" asked Esther,",Little Women
514,who always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I like the diamonds best, but there is no necklace among them, and I'm",Little Women
514,"fond of necklaces, they are so becoming.  I should choose this if I",Little Women
514,"might,"" replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a string of gold",Little Women
514,and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the same.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I, too, covet that, but not as a necklace.  Ah, no!  To me it is a",Little Women
514,"rosary, and as such I should use it like a good catholic,"" said Esther,",Little Women
514,eyeing the handsome thing wistfully.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Is it meant to use as you use the string of good-smelling wooden beads",Little Women
514,"hanging over your glass?"" asked Amy.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Truly, yes, to pray with.  It would be pleasing to the saints if one",Little Women
514,"used so fine a rosary as this, instead of wearing it as a vain bijou.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers, Esther, and",Little Women
514,"always come down looking quiet and satisfied.  I wish I could.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""If Mademoiselle was a Catholic, she would find true comfort, but as",Little Women
514,"that is not to be, it would be well if you went apart each day to",Little Women
514,"meditate and pray, as did the good mistress whom I served before",Little Women
514,"Madame.  She had a little chapel, and in it found solacement for much",Little Women
514,"trouble.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Would it be right for me to do so too?"" asked Amy, who in her",Little Women
514,"loneliness felt the need of help of some sort, and found that she was",Little Women
514,"apt to forget her little book, now that Beth was not there to remind",Little Women
514,her of it.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It would be excellent and charming, and I shall gladly arrange the",Little Women
514,"little dressing room for you if you like it.  Say nothing to Madame,",Little Women
514,but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good,Little Women
514,"thoughts, and pray the dear God preserve your sister.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Esther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice, for she had an",Little Women
514,"affectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety.",Little Women
514,"Amy liked the idea, and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next",Little Women
514,"her room, hoping it would do her good.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt March",Little Women
514,"dies,"" she said, as she slowly replaced the shining rosary and shut the",Little Women
514,jewel cases one by one.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""To you and your sisters.  I know it, Madame confides in me. I",Little Women
514,"witnessed her will, and it is to be so,"" whispered Esther smiling.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How nice!  But I wish she'd let us have them now. Procrastination is",Little Women
514,"not agreeable,"" observed Amy, taking a last look at the diamonds.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things. The",Little Women
514,"first one who is affianced will have the pearls, Madame has said it,",Little Women
514,and I have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you,Little Women
514,"when you go, for Madame approves your good behavior and charming",Little Women
514,"manners.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Do you think so?  Oh, I'll be a lamb, if I can only have that lovely",Little Women
514,ring!  It's ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant's.  I do like Aunt,Little Women
514,"March after all."" And Amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face",Little Women
514,and a firm resolve to earn it.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"From that day she was a model of obedience, and the old lady",Little Women
514,complacently admired the success of her training.  Esther fitted up the,Little Women
514,"closet with a little table, placed a footstool before it, and over it a",Little Women
514,picture taken from one of the shut-up rooms.  She thought it was of no,Little Women
514,"great value, but, being appropriate, she borrowed it, well knowing that",Little Women
514,"Madame would never know it, nor care if she did.  It was, however, a",Little Women
514,"very valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world, and",Little Women
514,Amy's beauty-loving eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet,Little Women
514,"face of the Divine Mother, while her tender thoughts of her own were",Little Women
514,busy at her heart.  On the table she laid her little testament and,Little Women
514,"hymnbook, kept a vase always full of the best flowers Laurie brought",Little Women
514,"her, and came every day to 'sit alone' thinking good thoughts, and",Little Women
514,praying the dear God to preserve her sister.  Esther had given her a,Little Women
514,"rosary of black beads with a silver cross, but Amy hung it up and did",Little Women
514,"not use it, feeling doubtful as to its fitness for Protestant prayers.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The little girl was very sincere in all this, for being left alone",Little Women
514,"outside the safe home nest, she felt the need of some kind hand to hold",Little Women
514,by so sorely that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender,Little Women
514,"Friend, whose fatherly love most closely surrounds His little children.",Little Women
514,"She missed her mother's help to understand and rule herself, but having",Little Women
514,"been taught where to look, she did her best to find the way and walk in",Little Women
514,"it confidingly.  But, Amy was a young pilgrim, and just now her burden",Little Women
514,"seemed very heavy. She tried to forget herself, to keep cheerful, and",Little Women
514,"be satisfied with doing right, though no one saw or praised her for it.",Little Women
514,"In her first effort at being very, very good, she decided to make her",Little Women
514,"will, as Aunt March had done, so that if she did fall ill and die, her",Little Women
514,possessions might be justly and generously divided.  It cost her a pang,Little Women
514,even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were,Little Women
514,as precious as the old lady's jewels.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,During one of her play hours she wrote out the important document as,Little Women
514,"well as she could, with some help from Esther as to certain legal",Little Women
514,"terms, and when the good-natured Frenchwoman had signed her name, Amy",Little Women
514,"felt relieved and laid it by to show Laurie, whom she wanted as a",Little Women
514,"second witness.  As it was a rainy day, she went upstairs to amuse",Little Women
514,"herself in one of the large chambers, and took Polly with her for",Little Women
514,company.  In this room there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned,Little Women
514,"costumes with which Esther allowed her to play, and it was her favorite",Little Women
514,"amusement to array herself in the faded brocades, and parade up and",Little Women
514,"down before the long mirror, making stately curtsies, and sweeping her",Little Women
514,train about with a rustle which delighted her ears.  So busy was she on,Little Women
514,this day that she did not hear Laurie's ring nor see his face peeping,Little Women
514,"in at her as she gravely promenaded to and fro, flirting her fan and",Little Women
514,"tossing her head, on which she wore a great pink turban, contrasting",Little Women
514,oddly with her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat.  She,Little Women
514,"was obliged to walk carefully, for she had on high-heeled shoes, and, as",Little Women
514,"Laurie told Jo afterward, it was a comical sight to see her mince along",Little Women
514,"in her gay suit, with Polly sidling and bridling just behind her,",Little Women
514,"imitating her as well as he could, and occasionally stopping to laugh",Little Women
514,"or exclaim, ""Ain't we fine? Get along, you fright!  Hold your tongue!",Little Women
514,"Kiss me, dear!  Ha! Ha!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment, lest it",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Sit down and rest while I put these things away, then I want to",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"She explained and then asked anxiously, ""What about Beth?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm sorry I spoke, but as I did, I'll tell you.  She felt so ill one",Little Women
514,"day that she told Jo she wanted to give her piano to Meg, her cats to",Little Women
514,"you, and the poor old doll to Jo, who would love it for her sake.  She",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke, and did not look up till a",Little Women

514,"sometimes?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, 'codicils', they call them.""",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie added it, smiling at Amy's last and greatest sacrifice. Then he",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"When he had gone, she went to her little chapel, and sitting in the",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,CONFIDENTIAL,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,I don't think I have any words in which to tell the meeting of the,Little Women
514,"mother and daughters.  Such hours are beautiful to live, but very hard",Little Women
514,"to describe, so I will leave it to the imagination of my readers,",Little Women
514,"merely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness, and that",Little Women
514,"Meg's tender hope was realized, for when Beth woke from that long,",Little Women
514,"healing sleep, the first objects on which her eyes fell were the little",Little Women
514,"rose and Mother's face.  Too weak to wonder at anything, she only",Little Women
514,"smiled and nestled close in the loving arms about her, feeling that the",Little Women
514,"hungry longing was satisfied at last.  Then she slept again, and the",Little Women
514,"girls waited upon their mother, for she would not unclasp the thin hand",Little Women
514,which clung to hers even in sleep.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Hannah had 'dished up' an astonishing breakfast for the traveler,",Little Women
514,"finding it impossible to vent her excitement in any other way, and Meg",Little Women
514,"and Jo fed their mother like dutiful young storks, while they listened",Little Women
514,"to her whispered account of Father's state, Mr. Brooke's promise to",Little Women
514,"stay and nurse him, the delays which the storm occasioned on the",Little Women
514,"homeward journey, and the unspeakable comfort Laurie's hopeful face had",Little Women
514,"given her when she arrived, worn out with fatigue, anxiety, and cold.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,What a strange yet pleasant day that was.  So brilliant and gay,Little Women
514,"without, for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow.  So",Little Women
514,"quiet and reposeful within, for everyone slept, spent with watching,",Little Women
514,"and a Sabbath stillness reigned through the house, while nodding Hannah",Little Women
514,mounted guard at the door.  With a blissful sense of burdens lifted,Little Women
514,"off, Meg and Jo closed their weary eyes, and lay at rest, like",Little Women
514,storm-beaten boats safe at anchor in a quiet harbor.  Mrs. March would,Little Women
514,"not leave Beth's side, but rested in the big chair, waking often to",Little Women
514,"look at, touch, and brood over her child, like a miser over some",Little Women
514,recovered treasure.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort Amy, and told his story so well",Little Women
514,"that Aunt March actually 'sniffed' herself, and never once said ""I told",Little Women
514,"you so"".  Amy came out so strong on this occasion that I think the good",Little Women
514,thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit.  She dried,Little Women
514,"her tears quickly, restrained her impatience to see her mother, and",Little Women
514,"never even thought of the turquoise ring, when the old lady heartily",Little Women
514,"agreed in Laurie's opinion, that she behaved 'like a capital little",Little Women
514,"woman'.  Even Polly seemed impressed, for he called her a good girl,",Little Women
514,"blessed her buttons, and begged her to ""come and take a walk, dear"", in",Little Women
514,his most affable tone.  She would very gladly have gone out to enjoy,Little Women
514,"the bright wintry weather, but discovering that Laurie was dropping",Little Women
514,"with sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact, she",Little Women
514,"persuaded him to rest on the sofa, while she wrote a note to her",Little Women
514,"mother.  She was a long time about it, and when she returned, he was",Little Women
514,"stretched out with both arms under his head, sound asleep, while Aunt",Little Women
514,March had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual,Little Women
514,fit of benignity.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"After a while, they began to think he was not going to wake up till",Little Women
514,"night, and I'm not sure that he would, had he not been effectually",Little Women
514,roused by Amy's cry of joy at sight of her mother. There probably were,Little Women
514,"a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day, but it",Little Women
514,"is my private opinion that Amy was the happiest of all, when she sat in",Little Women
514,"her mother's lap and told her trials, receiving consolation and",Little Women
514,compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses.  They,Little Women
514,"were alone together in the chapel, to which her mother did not object",Little Women
514,when its purpose was explained to her.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""On the contrary, I like it very much, dear,"" looking from the dusty",Little Women
514,"rosary to the well-worn little book, and the lovely picture with its",Little Women
514,"garland of evergreen.  ""It is an excellent plan to have some place",Little Women
514,"where we can go to be quiet, when things vex or grieve us.  There are a",Little Women
514,"good many hard times in this life of ours, but we can always bear them",Little Women
514,if we ask help in the right way.  I think my little girl is learning,Little Women
514,"this.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, Mother, and when I go home I mean to have a corner in the big",Little Women
514,closet to put my books and the copy of that picture which I've tried to,Little Women
514,"make.  The woman's face is not good, it's too beautiful for me to draw,",Little Women
514,"but the baby is done better, and I love it very much.  I like to think",Little Women
514,"He was a little child once, for then I don't seem so far away, and that",Little Women
514,"helps me.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As Amy pointed to the smiling Christ child on his Mother's knee, Mrs.",Little Women
514,March saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile.  She said,Little Women
514,"nothing, but Amy understood the look, and after a minute's pause, she",Little Women
514,"added gravely, ""I wanted to speak to you about this, but I forgot it.",Little Women
514,"Aunt gave me the ring today.  She called me to her and kissed me, and",Little Women
514,"put it on my finger, and said I was a credit to her, and she'd like to",Little Women
514,"keep me always. She gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on, as",Little Women
514,"it's too big.  I'd like to wear them Mother, can I?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""They are very pretty, but I think you're rather too young for such",Little Women
514,"ornaments, Amy,"" said Mrs. March, looking at the plump little hand,",Little Women
514,"with the band of sky-blue stones on the forefinger, and the quaint",Little Women
514,guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll try not to be vain,"" said Amy.  ""I don't think I like it only",Little Women
514,"because it's so pretty, but I want to wear it as the girl in the story",Little Women
514,"wore her bracelet, to remind me of something.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Do you mean Aunt March?"" asked her mother, laughing.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, to remind me not to be selfish.""  Amy looked so earnest and",Little Women
514,"sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing, and listened",Little Women
514,respectfully to the little plan.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I've thought a great deal lately about my 'bundle of naughties', and",Little Women
514,"being selfish is the largest one in it, so I'm going to try hard to",Little Women
514,"cure it, if I can.  Beth isn't selfish, and that's the reason everyone",Little Women
514,loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her.  People,Little Women
514,"wouldn't feel so bad about me if I was sick, and I don't deserve to",Little Women
514,"have them, but I'd like to be loved and missed by a great many friends,",Little Women
514,so I'm going to try and be like Beth all I can.  I'm apt to forget my,Little Women
514,"resolutions, but if I had something always about me to remind me, I",Little Women
514,"guess I should do better.  May we try this way?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, but I have more faith in the corner of the big closet. Wear your",Little Women
514,"ring, dear, and do your best.  I think you will prosper, for the",Little Women
514,sincere wish to be good is half the battle.  Now I must go back to,Little Women
514,"Beth.  Keep up your heart, little daughter, and we will soon have you",Little Women
514,"home again.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,That evening while Meg was writing to her father to report the,Little Women
514,"traveler's safe arrival, Jo slipped upstairs into Beth's room, and",Little Women
514,"finding her mother in her usual place, stood a minute twisting her",Little Women
514,"fingers in her hair, with a worried gesture and an undecided look.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What is it, deary?"" asked Mrs. March, holding out her hand, with a",Little Women
514,face which invited confidence.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I want to tell you something, Mother.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""About Meg?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How quickly you guessed!  Yes, it's about her, and though it's a",Little Women
514,"little thing, it fidgets me.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Beth is asleep.  Speak low, and tell me all about it.  That Moffat",Little Women
514,"hasn't been here, I hope?"" asked Mrs. March rather sharply.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No.  I should have shut the door in his face if he had,"" said Jo,",Little Women
514,"settling herself on the floor at her mother's feet.  ""Last summer Meg",Little Women
514,left a pair of gloves over at the Laurences' and only one was returned.,Little Women
514,"We forgot about it, till Teddy told me that Mr. Brooke owned that he",Little Women
514,"liked Meg but didn't dare say so, she was so young and he so poor.",Little Women
514,"Now, isn't it a dreadful state of things?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Do you think Meg cares for him?"" asked Mrs. March, with an anxious",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Mercy me!  I don't know anything about love and such nonsense!"" cried",Little Women
514,"Jo, with a funny mixture of interest and contempt. ""In novels, the",Little Women
514,"girls show it by starting and blushing, fainting away, growing thin,",Little Women
514,and acting like fools.  Now Meg does not do anything of the sort.  She,Little Women
514,"eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible creature, she looks straight",Little Women
514,"in my face when I talk about that man, and only blushes a little bit",Little Women
514,"when Teddy jokes about lovers.  I forbid him to do it, but he doesn't",Little Women
514,"mind me as he ought.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""My dear, don't get angry about it, and I will tell you how it",Little Women
514,"happened.  John went with me at Mr. Laurence's request, and was so",Little Women
514,devoted to poor Father that we couldn't help getting fond of him.  He,Little Women
514,"was perfectly open and honorable about Meg, for he told us he loved",Little Women
514,"her, but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry",Little Women
514,"him.  He only wanted our leave to love her and work for her, and the",Little Women
514,right to make her love him if he could. He is a truly excellent young,Little Women
514,"man, and we could not refuse to listen to him, but I will not consent",Little Women
514,"to Meg's engaging herself so young.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Of course not.  It would be idiotic!  I knew there was mischief",Little Women

514,,Little Women

514,"short reports he sent more than she did your letters, and pinched me",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"LAURIE MAKES MISCHIEF, AND JO MAKES PEACE",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo's face was a study next day, for the secret rather weighed upon her,",Little Women
514,and she found it hard not to look mysterious and important.  Meg,Little Women
514,"observed it, but did not trouble herself to make inquiries, for she had",Little Women
514,"learned that the best way to manage Jo was by the law of contraries, so",Little Women
514,she felt sure of being told everything if she did not ask.  She was,Little Women
514,"rather surprised, therefore, when the silence remained unbroken, and Jo",Little Women
514,"assumed a patronizing air, which decidedly aggravated Meg, who in turn",Little Women
514,assumed an air of dignified reserve and devoted herself to her mother.,Little Women
514,"This left Jo to her own devices, for Mrs. March had taken her place as",Little Women
514,"nurse, and bade her rest, exercise, and amuse herself after her long",Little Women
514,"confinement.  Amy being gone, Laurie was her only refuge, and much as",Little Women
514,"she enjoyed his society, she rather dreaded him just then, for he was",Little Women
514,"an incorrigible tease, and she feared he would coax the secret from her.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She was quite right, for the mischief-loving lad no sooner suspected a",Little Women
514,"mystery than he set himself to find it out, and led Jo a trying life of",Little Women
514,"it.  He wheedled, bribed, ridiculed, threatened, and scolded; affected",Little Women
514,"indifference, that he might surprise the truth from her; declared he",Little Women
514,"knew, then that he didn't care; and at last, by dint of perseverance,",Little Women
514,he satisfied himself that it concerned Meg and Mr. Brooke.  Feeling,Little Women
514,"indignant that he was not taken into his tutor's confidence, he set his",Little Women
514,wits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was absorbed in,Little Women
514,"preparations for her father's return, but all of a sudden a change",Little Women
514,"seemed to come over her, and, for a day or two, she was quite unlike",Little Women
514,"herself.  She started when spoken to, blushed when looked at, was very",Little Women
514,"quiet, and sat over her sewing, with a timid, troubled look on her",Little Women
514,"face.  To her mother's inquiries she answered that she was quite well,",Little Women
514,and Jo's she silenced by begging to be let alone.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""She feels it in the air--love, I mean--and she's going very fast.",Little Women
514,"She's got most of the symptoms--is twittery and cross, doesn't eat,",Little Women
514,"lies awake, and mopes in corners.  I caught her singing that song he",Little Women
514,"gave her, and once she said 'John', as you do, and then turned as red",Little Women
514,"as a poppy.  Whatever shall we do?"" said Jo, looking ready for any",Little Women
514,"measures, however violent.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Nothing but wait.  Let her alone, be kind and patient, and Father's",Little Women
514,"coming will settle everything,"" replied her mother.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Here's a note to you, Meg, all sealed up.  How odd! Teddy never seals",Little Women
514,"mine,"" said Jo next day, as she distributed the contents of the little",Little Women
514,post office.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Mrs. March and Jo were deep in their own affairs, when a sound from Meg",Little Women
514,made them look up to see her staring at her note with a frightened face.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""My child, what is it?"" cried her mother, running to her, while Jo",Little Women
514,tried to take the paper which had done the mischief.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's all a mistake, he didn't send it.  Oh, Jo, how could you do it?""",Little Women
514,"and Meg hid her face in her hands, crying as if her heart were quite",Little Women
514,broken.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Me!  I've done nothing!  What's she talking about?"" cried Jo,",Little Women
514,bewildered.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Meg's mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note from,Little Women
514,"her pocket and threw it at Jo, saying reproachfully, ""You wrote it, and",Little Women
514,"that bad boy helped you.  How could you be so rude, so mean, and cruel",Little Women
514,"to us both?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo hardly heard her, for she and her mother were reading the note,",Little Women
514,which was written in a peculiar hand.,Little Women

514,"""My Dearest Margaret,",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,consent if they knew that we adored one another.  Mr. Laurence will,Little Women
514,"help me to some good place, and then, my sweet girl, you will make me",Little Women
514,"happy.  I implore you to say nothing to your family yet, but to send",Little Women
514,"one word of hope through Laurie to,",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, the little villain!  That's the way he meant to pay me for keeping",Little Women

514,"to beg pardon,"" cried Jo, burning to execute immediate justice.  But",Little Women
514,"her mother held her back, saying, with a look she seldom wore...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Stop, Jo, you must clear yourself first.  You have played so many",Little Women
514,"pranks that I am afraid you have had a hand in this.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""On my word, Mother, I haven't!  I never saw that note before, and",Little Women
514,"don't know anything about it, as true as I live!"" said Jo, so earnestly",Little Women
514,"that they believed her.  ""If I had taken part in it I'd have done it",Little Women
514,"better than this, and have written a sensible note.  I should think",Little Women
514,"you'd have known Mr. Brooke wouldn't write such stuff as that,"" she",Little Women
514,"added, scornfully tossing down the paper.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's like his writing,"" faltered Meg, comparing it with the note in",Little Women
514,her hand.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, Meg, you didn't answer it?"" cried Mrs. March quickly.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, I did!"" and Meg hid her face again, overcome with shame.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Here's a scrape!  Do let me bring that wicked boy over to explain and",Little Women
514,"be lectured.  I can't rest till I get hold of him."" And Jo made for the",Little Women
514,door again.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Hush!  Let me handle this, for it is worse than I thought. Margaret,",Little Women
514,"tell me the whole story,"" commanded Mrs. March, sitting down by Meg,",Little Women
514,"yet keeping hold of Jo, lest she should fly off.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I received the first letter from Laurie, who didn't look as if he knew",Little Women
514,"anything about it,"" began Meg, without looking up. ""I was worried at",Little Women
514,"first and meant to tell you, then I remembered how you liked Mr.",Little Women
514,"Brooke, so I thought you wouldn't mind if I kept my little secret for a",Little Women
514,"few days.  I'm so silly that I liked to think no one knew, and while I",Little Women
514,"was deciding what to say, I felt like the girls in books, who have such",Little Women
514,"things to do.  Forgive me, Mother, I'm paid for my silliness now.  I",Little Women
514,"never can look him in the face again.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What did you say to him?"" asked Mrs. March.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I only said I was too young to do anything about it yet, that I didn't",Little Women
514,"wish to have secrets from you, and he must speak to father.  I was very",Little Women
514,"grateful for his kindness, and would be his friend, but nothing more,",Little Women
514,"for a long while.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Mrs. March smiled, as if well pleased, and Jo clapped her hands,",Little Women
514,"exclaiming, with a laugh, ""You are almost equal to Caroline Percy, who",Little Women
514,"was a pattern of prudence!  Tell on, Meg. What did he say to that?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""He writes in a different way entirely, telling me that he never sent",Little Women
514,"any love letter at all, and is very sorry that my roguish sister, Jo,",Little Women
514,"should take liberties with our names.  It's very kind and respectful,",Little Women
514,"but think how dreadful for me!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg leaned against her mother, looking the image of despair, and Jo",Little Women
514,"tramped about the room, calling Laurie names.  All of a sudden she",Little Women
514,"stopped, caught up the two notes, and after looking at them closely,",Little Women
514,"said decidedly, ""I don't believe Brooke ever saw either of these",Little Women
514,"letters.  Teddy wrote both, and keeps yours to crow over me with",Little Women
514,"because I wouldn't tell him my secret.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't have any secrets, Jo.  Tell it to Mother and keep out of",Little Women
514,"trouble, as I should have done,"" said Meg warningly.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Bless you, child!  Mother told me.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That will do, Jo.  I'll comfort Meg while you go and get Laurie.  I",Little Women
514,"shall sift the matter to the bottom, and put a stop to such pranks at",Little Women
514,"once.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Away ran Jo, and Mrs. March gently told Meg Mr. Brooke's real feelings.",Little Women
514,"""Now, dear, what are your own?  Do you love him enough to wait till he",Little Women
514,"can make a home for you, or will you keep yourself quite free for the",Little Women
514,"present?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I've been so scared and worried, I don't want to have anything to do",Little Women
514,"with lovers for a long while, perhaps never,"" answered Meg petulantly.",Little Women
514,"""If John doesn't know anything about this nonsense, don't tell him, and",Little Women
514,make Jo and Laurie hold their tongues.  I won't be deceived and plagued,Little Women
514,"and made a fool of. It's a shame!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Seeing Meg's usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by,Little Women
514,"this mischievous joke, Mrs. March soothed her by promises of entire",Little Women
514,silence and great discretion for the future.  The instant Laurie's step,Little Women
514,"was heard in the hall, Meg fled into the study, and Mrs. March received",Little Women
514,"the culprit alone. Jo had not told him why he was wanted, fearing he",Little Women
514,"wouldn't come, but he knew the minute he saw Mrs. March's face, and",Little Women
514,stood twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once.,Little Women
514,"Jo was dismissed, but chose to march up and down the hall like a",Little Women
514,"sentinel, having some fear that the prisoner might bolt.  The sound of",Little Women
514,"voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour, but what happened",Little Women
514,during that interview the girls never knew.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"When they were called in, Laurie was standing by their mother with such",Little Women
514,"a penitent face that Jo forgave him on the spot, but did not think it",Little Women
514,"wise to betray the fact.  Meg received his humble apology, and was much",Little Women
514,comforted by the assurance that Brooke knew nothing of the joke.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll never tell him to my dying day, wild horses shan't drag it out of",Little Women
514,"me, so you'll forgive me, Meg, and I'll do anything to show how",Little Women
514,"out-and-out sorry I am,"" he added, looking very much ashamed of himself.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll try, but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do, I didn't think",Little Women
514,"you could be so sly and malicious, Laurie,"" replied Meg, trying to hide",Little Women
514,her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It was altogether abominable, and I don't deserve to be spoken to for",Little Women
514,"a month, but you will, though, won't you?"" And Laurie folded his hands",Little Women
514,"together with such and imploring gesture, as he spoke in his",Little Women
514,"irresistibly persuasive tone, that it was impossible to frown upon him",Little Women
514,in spite of his scandalous behavior.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg pardoned him, and Mrs. March's grave face relaxed, in spite of her",Little Women
514,"efforts to keep sober, when she heard him declare that he would atone",Little Women
514,"for his sins by all sorts of penances, and abase himself like a worm",Little Women
514,before the injured damsel.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her heart against him, and",Little Women
514,succeeding only in primming up her face into an expression of entire,Little Women
514,"disapprobation.  Laurie looked at her once or twice, but as she showed",Little Women
514,"no sign of relenting, he felt injured, and turned his back on her till",Little Women
514,"the others were done with him, when he made her a low bow and walked",Little Women
514,off without a word.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As soon as he had gone, she wished she had been more forgiving, and",Little Women
514,"when Meg and her mother went upstairs, she felt lonely and longed for",Little Women
514,"Teddy.  After resisting for some time, she yielded to the impulse, and",Little Women
514,"armed with a book to return, went over to the big house.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Is Mr. Laurence in?"" asked Jo, of a housemaid, who was coming",Little Women

514,,Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Why not?  Is he ill?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""La, no Miss, but he's had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is in one of",Little Women

514,"dursn't go nigh him.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Where is Laurie?""",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll go and see what the matter is.  I'm not afraid of either of them.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Up went Jo, and knocked smartly on the door of Laurie's little study.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Stop that, or I'll open the door and make you!"" called out the young",Little Women
514,gentleman in a threatening tone.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo immediately knocked again.  The door flew open, and in she bounced",Little Women
514,before Laurie could recover from his surprise.  Seeing that he really,Little Women
514,"was out of temper, Jo, who knew how to manage him, assumed a contrite",Little Women
514,"expression, and going artistically down upon her knees, said meekly,",Little Women
514,"""Please forgive me for being so cross.  I came to make it up, and can't",Little Women
514,"go away till I have.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,reply to her petition.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Thank you, I will.  Could I ask what's the matter?  You don't look",Little Women
514,"exactly easy in your mind.""",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Grandfather.  If it had been anyone else I'd have..."" And the injured",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""That's nothing.  I often shake you, and you don't mind,"" said Jo",Little Women
514,soothingly.,Little Women

514,"and he stood at the foot, a lion in the path, so she had to stay and",Little Women
514,brave it out.,Little Women

514,"""Indeed, Sir, I cannot tell.  Mother forbade it.  Laurie has confessed,",Little Women

514,"shield him, but someone else, and it will make more trouble if you",Little Women
514,"interfere.  Please don't.  It was partly my fault, but it's all right",Little Women

514,"The threat sounded awful, but did not alarm Jo, for she knew the",Little Women

514,made as light of the prank as she could without betraying Meg or,Little Women
514,forgetting the truth.,Little Women

514,"""Hum... ha... well, if the boy held his tongue because he promised, and",Little Women

514,"to manage,"" said Mr. Laurence, rubbing up his hair till it looked as if",Little Women
514,"he had been out in a gale, and smoothing the frown from his brow with",Little Women
514,an air of relief.,Little Women

514,"""So am I, but a kind word will govern me when all the king's horses and",Little Women

514,another.,Little Women

514,"""You think I'm not kind to him, hey?"" was the sharp answer.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, dear no, Sir.  You are rather too kind sometimes, and then just a",Little Women
514,"trifle hasty when he tries your patience.  Don't you think you are?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo was determined to have it out now, and tried to look quite placid,",Little Women
514,though she quaked a little after her bold speech. To her great relief,Little Women
514,"and surprise, the old gentleman only threw his spectacles onto the",Little Women
514,"table with a rattle and exclaimed frankly, ""You're right, girl, I am!",Little Women
514,"I love the boy, but he tries my patience past bearing, and I know how",Little Women
514,"it will end, if we go on so.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll tell you, he'll run away."" Jo was sorry for that speech the",Little Women
514,minute it was made.  She meant to warn him that Laurie would not bear,Little Women
514,"much restraint, and hoped he would be more forebearing with the lad.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Mr. Laurence's ruddy face changed suddenly, and he sat down, with a",Little Women
514,"troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man, which hung over his",Little Women
514,"table.  It was Laurie's father, who had run away in his youth, and",Little Women
514,married against the imperious old man's will. Jo fancied he remembered,Little Women
514,"and regretted the past, and she wished she had held her tongue.",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""He won't come, Sir.  He feels badly because you didn't believe him",Little Women

514,"very much.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed, for Mr. Laurence began",Little Women
514,"to laugh, and she knew the day was won.",Little Women

514,"""I'm sorry for that, and ought to thank him for not shaking me, I",Little Women
514,"suppose.  What the dickens does the fellow expect?"" and the old",Little Women
514,gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness.,Little Women

514,"""If I were you, I'd write him an apology, Sir.  He says he won't come",Little Women
514,"down till he has one, and talks about Washington, and goes on in an",Little Women
514,"absurd way.  A formal apology will make him see how foolish he is, and",Little Women
514,"bring him down quite amiable.  Try it.  He likes fun, and this way is",Little Women
514,"better than talking.  I'll carry it up, and teach him his duty.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Mr. Laurence gave her a sharp look, and put on his spectacles, saying",Little Women
514,"slowly, ""You're a sly puss, but I don't mind being managed by you and",Little Women

514,"nonsense.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,The note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to,Little Women
514,another after offering some deep insult.  Jo dropped a kiss on the top,Little Women
514,"of Mr. Laurence's bald head, and ran up to slip the apology under",Little Women
514,"Laurie's door, advising him through the keyhole to be submissive,",Little Women
514,"decorous, and a few other agreeable impossibilities. Finding the door",Little Women
514,"locked again, she left the note to do its work, and was going quietly",Little Women
514,"away, when the young gentleman slid down the banisters, and waited for",Little Women
514,"her at the bottom, saying, with his most virtuous expression of",Little Women
514,"countenance, ""What a good fellow you are, Jo! Did you get blown up?"" he",Little Women
514,"added, laughing.",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,Like sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which followed.,Little Women
514,"The invalids improved rapidly, and Mr. March began to talk of returning",Little Women
514,early in the new year.  Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all,Little Women
514,"day, amusing herself with the well-beloved cats at first, and in time",Little Women
514,"with doll's sewing, which had fallen sadly behind-hand.  Her once",Little Women
514,active limbs were so stiff and feeble that Jo took her for a daily,Little Women
514,airing about the house in her strong arms.  Meg cheerfully blackened,Little Women
514,"and burned her white hands cooking delicate messes for 'the dear',",Little Women
514,"while Amy, a loyal slave of the ring, celebrated her return by giving",Little Women
514,away as many of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to,Little Women
514,accept.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt the house,",Little Women
514,and Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible,Little Women
514,"or magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor of this unusually merry",Little Women
514,"Christmas.  Laurie was equally impracticable, and would have had",Little Women
514,"bonfires, skyrockets, and triumphal arches, if he had had his own way.",Little Women
514,"After many skirmishes and snubbings, the ambitious pair were considered",Little Women
514,"effectually quenched and went about with forlorn faces, which were",Little Women
514,rather belied by explosions of laughter when the two got together.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid,Little Women
514,Christmas Day.  Hannah 'felt in her bones' that it was going to be an,Little Women
514,"unusually fine day, and she proved herself a true prophetess, for",Little Women
514,everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success.  To,Little Women
514,"begin with, Mr. March wrote that he should soon be with them, then Beth",Little Women
514,"felt uncommonly well that morning, and, being dressed in her mother's",Little Women
514,"gift, a soft crimson merino wrapper, was borne in high triumph to the",Little Women
514,window to behold the offering of Jo and Laurie.  The Unquenchables had,Little Women
514,"done their best to be worthy of the name, for like elves they had",Little Women
514,worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise.  Out in the garden,Little Women
514,"stood a stately snow maiden, crowned with holly, bearing a basket of",Little Women
514,"fruit and flowers in one hand, a great roll of music in the other, a",Little Women

514,"hold one drop more,"" said Beth, quite sighing with contentment as Jo",Little Women

514,refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the 'Jungfrau' had,Little Women
514,sent her.,Little Women

514,"""I'm sure I am,"" echoed Amy, poring over the engraved copy of the",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Of course I am!"" cried Meg, smoothing the silvery folds of her first",Little Women
514,"silk dress, for Mr. Laurence had insisted on giving it. ""How can I be",Little Women
514,"otherwise?"" said Mrs. March gratefully, as her eyes went from her",Little Women
514,"husband's letter to Beth's smiling face, and her hand caressed the",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Now and then, in this workaday world, things do happen in the",Little Women
514,"delightful storybook fashion, and what a comfort it is.  Half an hour",Little Women
514,after everyone had said they were so happy they could only hold one,Little Women
514,"drop more, the drop came.  Laurie opened the parlor door and popped his",Little Women
514,head in very quietly.  He might just as well have turned a somersault,Little Women
514,"and uttered an Indian war whoop, for his face was so full of suppressed",Little Women
514,excitement and his voice so treacherously joyful that everyone jumped,Little Women
514,"up, though he only said, in a queer, breathless voice, ""Here's another",Little Women
514,"Christmas present for the March family.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Before the words were well out of his mouth, he was whisked away",Little Women
514,"somehow, and in his place appeared a tall man, muffled up to the eyes,",Little Women
514,"leaning on the arm of another tall man, who tried to say something and",Little Women
514,"couldn't.  Of course there was a general stampede, and for several",Little Women
514,"minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits, for the strangest things",Little Women
514,"were done, and no one said a word.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Mr. March became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of loving arms.,Little Women
514,"Jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away, and had to be doctored by",Little Women
514,"Laurie in the china closet.  Mr. Brooke kissed Meg entirely by mistake,",Little Women
514,"as he somewhat incoherently explained.  And Amy, the dignified, tumbled",Little Women
514,"over a stool, and never stopping to get up, hugged and cried over her",Little Women
514,father's boots in the most touching manner.  Mrs. March was the first,Little Women
514,"to recover herself, and held up her hand with a warning, ""Hush!",Little Women
514,"Remember Beth.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"But it was too late.  The study door flew open, the little red wrapper",Little Women
514,"appeared on the threshold, joy put strength into the feeble limbs, and",Little Women
514,Beth ran straight into her father's arms.  Never mind what happened,Little Women
514,"just after that, for the full hearts overflowed, washing away the",Little Women
514,bitterness of the past and leaving only the sweetness of the present.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody straight",Little Women
514,"again, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing over the fat",Little Women
514,"turkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the",Little Women
514,"kitchen.  As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March began to thank Mr. Brooke",Little Women
514,"for his faithful care of her husband, at which Mr. Brooke suddenly",Little Women
514,"remembered that Mr. March needed rest, and seizing Laurie, he",Little Women
514,"precipitately retired.  Then the two invalids were ordered to repose,",Little Women
514,"which they did, by both sitting in one big chair and talking hard.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Mr. March told how he had longed to surprise them, and how, when the",Little Women
514,"fine weather came, he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage",Little Women
514,"of it, how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was altogether a most",Little Women
514,estimable and upright young man.  Why Mr. March paused a minute just,Little Women
514,"there, and after a glance at Meg, who was violently poking the fire,",Little Women
514,"looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows, I leave you",Little Women
514,"to imagine.  Also why Mrs. March gently nodded her head and asked,",Little Women
514,"rather abruptly, if he wouldn't like to have something to eat.  Jo saw",Little Women
514,"and understood the look, and she stalked grimly away to get wine and",Little Women
514,"beef tea, muttering to herself as she slammed the door, ""I hate",Little Women
514,"estimable young men with brown eyes!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,There never was such a Christmas dinner as they had that day. The fat,Little Women
514,"turkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up, stuffed,",Little Women
514,"browned, and decorated.  So was the plum pudding, which melted in one's",Little Women
514,"mouth, likewise the jellies, in which Amy reveled like a fly in a",Little Women
514,"honeypot.  Everything turned out well, which was a mercy, Hannah said,",Little Women
514,"""For my mind was that flustered, Mum, that it's a merrycle I didn't",Little Women
514,"roast the pudding, and stuff the turkey with raisins, let alone bilin'",Little Women
514,"of it in a cloth.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Mr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr. Brooke, at whom",Little Women
514,"Jo glowered darkly, to Laurie's infinite amusement. Two easy chairs",Little Women
514,"stood side by side at the head of the table, in which sat Beth and her",Little Women
514,"father, feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit.  They drank",Little Women
514,"healths, told stories, sang songs, 'reminisced', as the old folks say,",Little Women
514,"and had a thoroughly good time. A sleigh ride had been planned, but the",Little Women
514,"girls would not leave their father, so the guests departed early, and",Little Women
514,"as twilight gathered, the happy family sat together round the fire.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas we expected",Little Women
514,"to have.  Do you remember?"" asked Jo, breaking a short pause which had",Little Women
514,followed a long conversation about many things.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Rather a pleasant year on the whole!"" said Meg, smiling at the fire,",Little Women
514,and congratulating herself on having treated Mr. Brooke with dignity.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I think it's been a pretty hard one,"" observed Amy, watching the light",Little Women
514,shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes.,Little Women

514,"""I'm glad it's over, because we've got you back,"" whispered Beth, who",Little Women
514,sat on her father's knee.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Rather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims, especially",Little Women
514,"the latter part of it.  But you have got on bravely, and I think the",Little Women
514,"burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon,"" said Mr. March,",Little Women
514,looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered,Little Women
514,round him.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How do you know?  Did Mother tell you?"" asked Jo.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not much.  Straws show which way the wind blows, and I've made several",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, tell us what they are!"" cried Meg, who sat beside him.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Here is one."" And taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his",Little Women
514,"chair, he pointed to the roughened forefinger, a burn on the back, and",Little Women
514,"two or three little hard spots on the palm.  ""I remember a time when",Little Women
514,"this hand was white and smooth, and your first care was to keep it so.",Little Women
514,"It was very pretty then, but to me it is much prettier now, for in this",Little Women

514,"made to vanity, this hardened palm has earned something better than",Little Women
514,"blisters, and I'm sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will",Little Women
514,"last a long time, so much good will went into the stitches.  Meg, my",Little Women
514,"dear, I value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white",Little Women
514,"hands or fashionable accomplishments.  I'm proud to shake this good,",Little Women
514,"industrious little hand, and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it",Little Women
514,"away.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"If Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she received it",Little Women

514,"pale just now, with watching and anxiety, but I like to look at it, for",Little Women
514,"it has grown gentler, and her voice is lower.  She doesn't bounce, but",Little Women
514,"moves quietly, and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly",Little Women

514,"think of other people more and of herself less, and has decided to try",Little Women

514,AUNT MARCH SETTLES THE QUESTION,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Like bees swarming after their queen, mother and daughters hovered",Little Women
514,"about Mr. March the next day, neglecting everything to look at, wait",Little Women
514,"upon, and listen to the new invalid, who was in a fair way to be killed",Little Women
514,"by kindness.  As he sat propped up in a big chair by Beth's sofa, with",Little Women
514,"the other three close by, and Hannah popping in her head now and then",Little Women
514,"'to peek at the dear man', nothing seemed needed to complete their",Little Women
514,"happiness.  But something was needed, and the elder ones felt it,",Little Women
514,though none confessed the fact.  Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one,Little Women
514,"another with an anxious expression, as their eyes followed Meg.  Jo had",Little Women
514,"sudden fits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke's",Little Women
514,"umbrella, which had been left in the hall.  Meg was absent-minded, shy,",Little Women
514,"and silent, started when the bell rang, and colored when John's name",Little Women
514,"was mentioned.  Amy said, ""Everyone seemed waiting for something, and",Little Women
514,"couldn't settle down, which was queer, since Father was safe at home,""",Little Women
514,and Beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn't run over as,Little Women
514,usual.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie went by in the afternoon, and seeing Meg at the window, seemed",Little Women
514,"suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he fell down on one",Little Women
514,"knee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair, and clasped his hands",Little Women
514,"imploringly, as if begging some boon. And when Meg told him to behave",Little Women
514,"himself and go away, he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief,",Little Women
514,and staggered round the corner as if in utter despair.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What does the goose mean?"" said Meg, laughing and trying to look",Little Women
514,unconscious.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""He's showing you how your John will go on by-and-by. Touching, isn't",Little Women
514,"it?"" answered Jo scornfully.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't say my John, it isn't proper or true,"" but Meg's voice lingered",Little Women
514,"over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her.  ""Please don't",Little Women
514,"plague me, Jo, I've told you I don't care much about him, and there",Little Women

514,"to plague you and will bear it like a man, but I do wish it was all",Little Women
514,"settled.  I hate to wait, so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and",Little Women
514,"have it over quickly,"" said Jo pettishly.",Little Women

514,"""I can't say anything till he speaks, and he won't, because Father said",Little Women
514,"I was too young,"" began Meg, bending over her work with a queer little",Little Women

514,that point.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""If he did speak, you wouldn't know what to say, but would cry or",Little Women

514,"""I'm not so silly and weak as you think.  I know just what I should",Little Women

514,varying in her cheeks.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Would you mind telling me what you'd say?"" asked Jo more respectfully.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not at all.  You are sixteen now, quite old enough to be my confidant,",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't mean to have any.  It's fun to watch other people philander, but",Little Women
514,"I should feel like a fool doing it myself,"" said Jo, looking alarmed at",Little Women
514,the thought.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I think not, if you liked anyone very much, and he liked you.""  Meg",Little Women
514,"spoke as if to herself, and glanced out at the lane where she had often",Little Women
514,seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man,"" said Jo,",Little Women
514,rudely shortening her sister's little reverie.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, I should merely say, quite calmly and decidedly, 'Thank you, Mr.",Little Women
514,"Brooke, you are very kind, but I agree with Father that I am too young",Little Women
514,"to enter into any engagement at present, so please say no more, but let",Little Women
514,"us be friends as we were.'""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Hum, that's stiff and cool enough!  I don't believe you'll ever say",Little Women
514,"it, and I know he won't be satisfied if you do.  If he goes on like the",Little Women
514,"rejected lovers in books, you'll give in, rather than hurt his",Little Women
514,"feelings.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, I won't.  I shall tell him I've made up my mind, and shall walk",Little Women
514,"out of the room with dignity.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the dignified",Little Women
514,"exit, when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat and begin to",Little Women
514,sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam,Little Women
514,"in a given time.  Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change, and when",Little Women
514,"someone gave a modest tap, opened the door with a grim aspect which was",Little Women
514,anything but hospitable.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Good afternoon.  I came to get my umbrella, that is, to see how your",Little Women
514,"father finds himself today,"" said Mr. Brooke, getting a trifle confused",Little Women
514,as his eyes went from one telltale face to the other.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's very well, he's in the rack.  I'll get him, and tell it you are",Little Women
514,"here.""  And having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in",Little Women
514,"her reply, Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg a chance to make her",Little Women
514,"speech and air her dignity.  But the instant she vanished, Meg began to",Little Women
514,"sidle toward the door, murmuring...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Mother will like to see you.  Pray sit down, I'll call her.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't go.  Are you afraid of me, Margaret?"" and Mr. Brooke looked so",Little Women
514,hurt that Meg thought she must have done something very rude.  She,Little Women
514,"blushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for he had never called",Little Women
514,"her Margaret before, and she was surprised to find how natural and",Little Women
514,sweet it seemed to hear him say it.  Anxious to appear friendly and at,Little Women
514,"her ease, she put out her hand with a confiding gesture, and said",Little Women
514,gratefully...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to Father? I only wish",Little Women
514,"I could thank you for it.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Shall I tell you how?"" asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small hand fast",Little Women
514,"in both his own, and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown",Little Women
514,"eyes that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed to run away",Little Women
514,and to stop and listen.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh no, please don't, I'd rather not,"" she said, trying to withdraw her",Little Women
514,"hand, and looking frightened in spite of her denial.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I won't trouble you.  I only want to know if you care for me a little,",Little Women
514,"Meg.  I love you so much, dear,"" added Mr. Brooke tenderly.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"This was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn't make",Little Women
514,"it.  She forgot every word of it, hung her head, and answered, ""I don't",Little Women
514,"know,"" so softly that John had to stoop down to catch the foolish",Little Women
514,little reply.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled to himself",Little Women
514,"as if quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand gratefully, and said in",Little Women
514,"his most persuasive tone, ""Will you try and find out?  I want to know",Little Women
514,"so much, for I can't go to work with any heart until I learn whether I",Little Women
514,"am to have my reward in the end or not.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm too young,"" faltered Meg, wondering why she was so fluttered, yet",Little Women
514,rather enjoying it.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll wait, and in the meantime, you could be learning to like me.",Little Women
514,"Would it be a very hard lesson, dear?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not if I chose to learn it, but. . .""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Please choose to learn, Meg.  I love to teach, and this is easier than",Little Women
514,"German,"" broke in John, getting possession of the other hand, so that",Little Women
514,she had no way of hiding her face as he bent to look into it.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"His tone was properly beseeching, but stealing a shy look at him, Meg",Little Women
514,"saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender, and that he wore the",Little Women
514,satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success.  This nettled,Little Women
514,"her.  Annie Moffat's foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind,",Little Women
514,"and the love of power, which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little",Little Women
514,"women, woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her.  She felt",Little Women
514,"excited and strange, and not knowing what else to do, followed a",Little Women
514,"capricious impulse, and, withdrawing her hands, said petulantly, ""I",Little Women
514,"don't choose.  Please go away and let me be!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Poor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling,Little Women
514,"about his ears, for he had never seen Meg in such a mood before, and it",Little Women
514,rather bewildered him.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Do you really mean that?"" he asked anxiously, following her as she",Little Women
514,walked away.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, I do.  I don't want to be worried about such things. Father says",Little Women
514,"I needn't, it's too soon and I'd rather not.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Mayn't I hope you'll change your mind by-and-by?  I'll wait and say",Little Women
514,"nothing till you have had more time.  Don't play with me, Meg.  I",Little Women
514,"didn't think that of you.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't think of me at all.  I'd rather you wouldn't,"" said Meg, taking",Little Women
514,a naughty satisfaction in trying her lover's patience and her own power.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He was grave and pale now, and looked decidedly more like the novel",Little Women
514,"heroes whom she admired, but he neither slapped his forehead nor",Little Women
514,tramped about the room as they did.  He just stood looking at her so,Little Women
514,"wistfully, so tenderly, that she found her heart relenting in spite of",Little Women
514,"herself.  What would have happened next I cannot say, if Aunt March had",Little Women
514,not come hobbling in at this interesting minute.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The old lady couldn't resist her longing to see her nephew, for she had",Little Women
514,"met Laurie as she took her airing, and hearing of Mr. March's arrival,",Little Women
514,drove straight out to see him.  The family were all busy in the back,Little Women
514,"part of the house, and she had made her way quietly in, hoping to",Little Women
514,surprise them.  She did surprise two of them so much that Meg started,Little Women
514,"as if she had seen a ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Bless me, what's all this?"" cried the old lady with a rap of her cane",Little Women
514,as she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's Father's friend.  I'm so surprised to see you!"" stammered Meg,",Little Women
514,feeling that she was in for a lecture now.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That's evident,"" returned Aunt March, sitting down.  ""But what is",Little Women
514,Father's friend saying to make you look like a peony? There's mischief,Little Women
514,"going on, and I insist upon knowing what it is,"" with another rap.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""We were only talking.  Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella,"" began Meg,",Little Women
514,wishing that Mr. Brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Brooke?  That boy's tutor?  Ah! I understand now.  I know all about",Little Women
514,"it.  Jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your Father's letters,",Little Women
514,"and I made her tell me.  You haven't gone and accepted him, child?""",Little Women
514,"cried Aunt March, looking scandalized.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Hush! He'll hear.  Shan't I call Mother?"" said Meg, much troubled.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not yet.  I've something to say to you, and I must free my mind at",Little Women
514,"once.  Tell me, do you mean to marry this Cook?  If you do, not one",Little Women
514,"penny of my money ever goes to you.  Remember that, and be a sensible",Little Women
514,"girl,"" said the old lady impressively.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of,Little Women
514,"opposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it.  The best of",Little Women
514,"us have a spice of perversity in us, especially when we are young and",Little Women
514,"in love.  If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke, she would",Little Women
514,"probably have declared she couldn't think of it, but as she was",Little Women
514,"preemptorily ordered not to like him, she immediately made up her mind",Little Women
514,that she would.  Inclination as well as perversity made the decision,Little Women
514,"easy, and being already much excited, Meg opposed the old lady with",Little Women
514,unusual spirit.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can leave your money",Little Women
514,"to anyone you like,"" she said, nodding her head with a resolute air.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Highty-tighty!  Is that the way you take my advice, Miss? You'll be",Little Women

514,"not know her in this new mood.  Meg hardly knew herself, she felt so",Little Women
514,"brave and independent, so glad to defend John and assert her right to",Little Women
514,"love him, if she liked.  Aunt March saw that she had begun wrong, and",Little Women
514,"after a little pause, made a fresh start, saying as mildly as she",Little Women
514,"could, ""Now, Meg, my dear, be reasonable and take my advice.  I mean it",Little Women
514,"kindly, and don't want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake",Little Women
514,at the beginning.  You ought to marry well and help your family.  It's,Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Meg stopped there, remembering all of a sudden that she hadn't made up",Little Women

514,overhearing her inconsistent remarks.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Aunt March was very angry, for she had set her heart on having her",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, I wash my hands of the whole affair!  You are a willful child,",Little Women

514,"threshold by a spectacle which held her there, staring with her mouth",Little Women
514,nearly as wide open as her eyes.  Going in to exult over a fallen enemy,Little Women
514,and to praise a strong-minded sister for the banishment of an,Little Women
514,"objectionable lover, it certainly was a shock to behold the aforesaid",Little Women
514,"enemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with the strongminded sister",Little Women
514,enthroned upon his knee and wearing an expression of the most abject,Little Women
514,"submission.  Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold shower bath had",Little Women
514,"suddenly fallen upon her, for such an unexpected turning of the tables",Little Women
514,actually took her breath away.  At the odd sound the lovers turned and,Little Women
514,"saw her.  Meg jumped up, looking both proud and shy, but 'that man', as",Little Women
514,"Jo called him, actually laughed and said coolly, as he kissed the",Little Women
514,"astonished newcomer, ""Sister Jo, congratulate us!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"That was adding insult to injury, it was altogether too much, and",Little Women
514,"making some wild demonstration with her hands, Jo vanished without a",Little Women
514,"word.  Rushing upstairs, she startled the invalids by exclaiming",Little Women
514,"tragically as she burst into the room, ""Oh, do somebody go down quick!",Little Women
514,"John Brooke is acting dreadfully, and Meg likes it!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Mr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed, and casting herself upon",Little Women
514,"the bed, Jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful news",Little Women
514,"to Beth and Amy.  The little girls, however, considered it a most",Little Women
514,"agreeable and interesting event, and Jo got little comfort from them,",Little Women
514,"so she went up to her refuge in the garret, and confided her troubles",Little Women
514,to the rats.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon, but a great",Little Women
514,"deal of talking was done, and quiet Mr. Brooke astonished his friends",Little Women
514,"by the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit, told his",Little Women
514,"plans, and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,The tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which,Little Women
514,"he meant to earn for Meg, and he proudly took her in to supper, both",Little Women
514,looking so happy that Jo hadn't the heart to be jealous or dismal. Amy,Little Women
514,"was very much impressed by John's devotion and Meg's dignity, Beth",Little Women
514,"beamed at them from a distance, while Mr. and Mrs. March surveyed the",Little Women
514,young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly,Little Women
514,evident Aunt March was right in calling them as 'unworldly as a pair of,Little Women
514,"babies'.  No one ate much, but everyone looked very happy, and the old",Little Women
514,room seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the,Little Women
514,family began there.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You can't say nothing pleasant ever happens now, can you, Meg?"" said",Little Women
514,"Amy, trying to decide how she would group the lovers in a sketch she",Little Women
514,was planning to make.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, I'm sure I can't.  How much has happened since I said that! It",Little Women
514,"seems a year ago,"" answered Meg, who was in a blissful dream lifted far",Little Women
514,above such common things as bread and butter.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""The joys come close upon the sorrows this time, and I rather think the",Little Women
514,"changes have begun,"" said Mrs. March.  ""In most families there comes,",Little Women
514,"now and then, a year full of events.  This has been such a one, but it",Little Women
514,"ends well, after all.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Hope the next will end better,"" muttered Jo, who found it very hard to",Little Women
514,"see Meg absorbed in a stranger before her face, for Jo loved a few",Little Women
514,persons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection lost or,Little Women
514,lessened in any way.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I hope the third year from this will end better.  I mean it shall, if",Little Women
514,"I live to work out my plans,"" said Mr. Brooke, smiling at Meg, as if",Little Women
514,everything had become possible to him now.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Doesn't it seem very long to wait?"" asked Amy, who was in a hurry for",Little Women
514,the wedding.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I've got so much to learn before I shall be ready, it seems a short",Little Women
514,"time to me,"" answered Meg, with a sweet gravity in her face never seen",Little Women
514,there before.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You have only to wait, I am to do the work,"" said John beginning his",Little Women
514,"labors by picking up Meg's napkin, with an expression which caused Jo",Little Women
514,"to shake her head, and then say to herself with an air of relief as the",Little Women
514,"front door banged, ""Here comes Laurie.  Now we shall have some sensible",Little Women
514,"conversation.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"But Jo was mistaken, for Laurie came prancing in, overflowing with good",Little Women
514,"spirits, bearing a great bridal-looking bouquet for 'Mrs. John Brooke',",Little Women
514,and evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had,Little Women
514,been brought about by his excellent management.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I knew Brooke would have it all his own way, he always does, for when",Little Women
514,"he makes up his mind to accomplish anything, it's done though the sky",Little Women
514,"falls,"" said Laurie, when he had presented his offering and his",Little Women
514,congratulations.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Much obliged for that recommendation.  I take it as a good omen for",Little Women
514,"the future and invite you to my wedding on the spot,"" answered Mr.",Little Women
514,"Brooke, who felt at peace with all mankind, even his mischievous pupil.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll come if I'm at the ends of the earth, for the sight of Jo's face",Little Women
514,alone on that occasion would be worth a long journey. You don't look,Little Women
514,"festive, ma'am, what's the matter?"" asked Laurie, following her into a",Little Women
514,"corner of the parlor, whither all had adjourned to greet Mr. Laurence.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I don't approve of the match, but I've made up my mind to bear it, and",Little Women
514,"shall not say a word against it,"" said Jo solemnly.  ""You can't know",Little Women
514,"how hard it is for me to give up Meg,"" she continued with a little",Little Women
514,quiver in her voice.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You don't give her up.  You only go halves,"" said Laurie consolingly.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It can never be the same again.  I've lost my dearest friend,"" sighed",Little Women
514,Jo.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You've got me, anyhow.  I'm not good for much, I know, but I'll stand",Little Women
514,"by you, Jo, all the days of my life.  Upon my word I will!"" and Laurie",Little Women
514,meant what he said.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I know you will, and I'm ever so much obliged.  You are always a great",Little Women
514,"comfort to me, Teddy,"" returned Jo, gratefully shaking hands.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, now, don't be dismal, there's a good fellow.  It's all right you",Little Women
514,"see.  Meg is happy, Brooke will fly round and get settled immediately,",Little Women
514,"Grandpa will attend to him, and it will be very jolly to see Meg in her",Little Women
514,"own little house.  We'll have capital times after she is gone, for I",Little Women
514,"shall be through college before long, and then we'll go abroad on some",Little Women
514,"nice trip or other.  Wouldn't that console you?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I rather think it would, but there's no knowing what may happen in",Little Women
514,"three years,"" said Jo thoughtfully.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That's true.  Don't you wish you could take a look forward and see",Little Women
514,"where we shall all be then?  I do,"" returned Laurie.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I think not, for I might see something sad, and everyone looks so",Little Women
514,"happy now, I don't believe they could be much improved."" And Jo's eyes",Little Women
514,"went slowly round the room, brightening as they looked, for the",Little Women
514,prospect was a pleasant one.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Father and Mother sat together, quietly reliving the first chapter of",Little Women
514,the romance which for them began some twenty years ago. Amy was drawing,Little Women

514,of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not,Little Women

514,held her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead,Little Women
514,him along the peaceful way she walked. Jo lounged in her favorite low,Little Women
514,"seat, with the grave quiet look which best became her, and Laurie,",Little Women
514,"leaning on the back of her chair, his chin on a level with her curly",Little Women
514,"head, smiled with his friendliest aspect, and nodded at her in the long",Little Women

514,And here let me premise that if any of the elders think there is too,Little Women
514,"much 'lovering' in the story, as I fear they may (I'm not afraid the",Little Women

514,"dashing young neighbor over the way?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,The three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the,Little Women
514,"quiet family.  The war is over, and Mr. March safely at home, busy with",Little Women
514,his books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature,Little Women
514,"as by grace, a quiet, studious man, rich in the wisdom that is better",Little Women
514,"than learning, the charity which calls all mankind 'brother', the piety",Little Women
514,"that blossoms into character, making it august and lovely.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"These attributes, in spite of poverty and the strict integrity which",Little Women
514,"shut him out from the more worldly successes, attracted to him many",Little Women
514,"admirable persons, as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees, and as",Little Women
514,naturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard,Little Women
514,experience had distilled no bitter drop.  Earnest young men found the,Little Women
514,gray-headed scholar as young at heart as they; thoughtful or troubled,Little Women
514,"women instinctively brought their doubts to him, sure of finding the",Little Women
514,"gentlest sympathy, the wisest counsel.  Sinners told their sins to the",Little Women
514,pure-hearted old man and were both rebuked and saved.  Gifted men found,Little Women
514,a companion in him.  Ambitious men caught glimpses of nobler ambitions,Little Women
514,"than their own, and even worldlings confessed that his beliefs were",Little Women
514,"beautiful and true, although 'they wouldn't pay'.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"To outsiders the five energetic women seemed to rule the house, and so",Little Women
514,"they did in many things, but the quiet scholar, sitting among his",Little Women
514,"books, was still the head of the family, the household conscience,",Little Women
514,"anchor, and comforter, for to him the busy, anxious women always turned",Little Women
514,"in troublous times, finding him, in the truest sense of those sacred",Little Women
514,"words, husband and father.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The girls gave their hearts into their mother's keeping, their souls",Little Women
514,"into their father's, and to both parents, who lived and labored so",Little Women
514,"faithfully for them, they gave a love that grew with their growth and",Little Women
514,bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and,Little Women
514,outlives death.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Mrs. March is as brisk and cheery, though rather grayer, than when we",Little Women
514,"saw her last, and just now so absorbed in Meg's affairs that the",Little Women
514,"hospitals and homes still full of wounded 'boys' and soldiers' widows,",Little Women
514,decidedly miss the motherly missionary's visits.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"John Brooke did his duty manfully for a year, got wounded, was sent",Little Women
514,"home, and not allowed to return.  He received no stars or bars, but he",Little Women
514,"deserved them, for he cheerfully risked all he had, and life and love",Little Women
514,are very precious when both are in full bloom.  Perfectly resigned to,Little Women
514,"his discharge, he devoted himself to getting well, preparing for",Little Women
514,"business, and earning a home for Meg.  With the good sense and sturdy",Little Women
514,"independence that characterized him, he refused Mr. Laurence's more",Little Women
514,"generous offers, and accepted the place of bookkeeper, feeling better",Little Women
514,satisfied to begin with an honestly earned salary than by running any,Little Women
514,risks with borrowed money.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting, growing womanly",Little Women
514,"in character, wise in housewifely arts, and prettier than ever, for",Little Women
514,"love is a great beautifier.  She had her girlish ambitions and hopes,",Little Women
514,and felt some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life,Little Women
514,"must begin.  Ned Moffat had just married Sallie Gardiner, and Meg",Little Women
514,"couldn't help contrasting their fine house and carriage, many gifts,",Little Women
514,"and splendid outfit with her own, and secretly wishing she could have",Little Women
514,the same.  But somehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she,Little Women
514,thought of all the patient love and labor John had put into the little,Little Women
514,"home awaiting her, and when they sat together in the twilight, talking",Little Women
514,"over their small plans, the future always grew so beautiful and bright",Little Women
514,"that she forgot Sallie's splendor and felt herself the richest,",Little Women
514,happiest girl in Christendom.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo never went back to Aunt March, for the old lady took such a fancy to",Little Women
514,Amy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of,Little Women
514,"the best teachers going, and for the sake of this advantage, Amy would",Little Women
514,"have served a far harder mistress.  So she gave her mornings to duty,",Little Women
514,"her afternoons to pleasure, and prospered finely. Jo meantime devoted",Little Women
514,"herself to literature and Beth, who remained delicate long after the",Little Women
514,"fever was a thing of the past.  Not an invalid exactly, but never again",Little Women
514,"the rosy, healthy creature she had been, yet always hopeful, happy, and",Little Women
514,"serene, and busy with the quiet duties she loved, everyone's friend,",Little Women
514,"and an angel in the house, long before those who loved her most had",Little Women
514,learned to know it.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,As long as _The Spread Eagle_ paid her a dollar a column for her,Little Women
514,"'rubbish', as she called it, Jo felt herself a woman of means, and spun",Little Women
514,her little romances diligently.  But great plans fermented in her busy,Little Women
514,"brain and ambitious mind, and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a",Little Women
514,"slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript, which was one day to",Little Women
514,place the name of March upon the roll of fame.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie, having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather, was",Little Women
514,now getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please,Little Women
514,"himself.  A universal favorite, thanks to money, manners, much talent,",Little Women
514,and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to,Little Women
514,"get other people out of them, he stood in great danger of being",Little Women
514,"spoiled, and probably would have been, like many another promising boy,",Little Women
514,if he had not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the,Little Women
514,"kind old man who was bound up in his success, the motherly friend who",Little Women
514,"watched over him as if he were her son, and last, but not least by any",Little Women
514,"means, the knowledge that four innocent girls loved, admired, and",Little Women
514,believed in him with all their hearts.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Being only 'a glorious human boy', of course he frolicked and flirted,",Little Women
514,"grew dandified, aquatic, sentimental, or gymnastic, as college fashions",Little Women
514,"ordained, hazed and was hazed, talked slang, and more than once came",Little Women
514,perilously near suspension and expulsion.  But as high spirits and the,Little Women
514,"love of fun were the causes of these pranks, he always managed to save",Little Women
514,"himself by frank confession, honorable atonement, or the irresistible",Little Women
514,"power of persuasion which he possessed in perfection.  In fact, he",Little Women
514,"rather prided himself on his narrow escapes, and liked to thrill the",Little Women
514,"girls with graphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors,",Little Women
514,"dignified professors, and vanquished enemies.  The 'men of my class',",Little Women
514,"were heroes in the eyes of the girls, who never wearied of the exploits",Little Women
514,"of 'our fellows', and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of",Little Women
514,"these great creatures, when Laurie brought them home with him.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Amy especially enjoyed this high honor, and became quite a belle among",Little Women
514,"them, for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of",Little Women
514,fascination with which she was endowed.  Meg was too much absorbed in,Little Women
514,her private and particular John to care for any other lords of,Little Women
514,"creation, and Beth too shy to do more than peep at them and wonder how",Little Women
514,"Amy dared to order them about so, but Jo felt quite in her own element,",Little Women
514,and found it very difficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly,Little Women
514,"attitudes, phrases, and feats, which seemed more natural to her than",Little Women
514,"the decorums prescribed for young ladies.  They all liked Jo immensely,",Little Women
514,"but never fell in love with her, though very few escaped without paying",Little Women
514,the tribute of a sentimental sigh or two at Amy's shrine.  And speaking,Little Women
514,of sentiment brings us very naturally to the 'Dovecote'.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,That was the name of the little brown house Mr. Brooke had prepared for,Little Women
514,"Meg's first home.  Laurie had christened it, saying it was highly",Little Women
514,appropriate to the gentle lovers who 'went on together like a pair of,Little Women
514,"turtledoves, with first a bill and then a coo'.  It was a tiny house,",Little Women
514,with a little garden behind and a lawn about as big as a pocket,Little Women
514,"handkerchief in the front.  Here Meg meant to have a fountain,",Little Women
514,"shrubbery, and a profusion of lovely flowers, though just at present",Little Women
514,"the fountain was represented by a weather-beaten urn, very like a",Little Women
514,"dilapidated slopbowl, the shrubbery consisted of several young larches,",Little Women
514,"undecided whether to live or die, and the profusion of flowers was",Little Women
514,merely hinted by regiments of sticks to show where seeds were planted.,Little Women
514,"But inside, it was altogether charming, and the happy bride saw no",Little Women
514,"fault from garret to cellar.  To be sure, the hall was so narrow it was",Little Women
514,"fortunate that they had no piano, for one never could have been got in",Little Women
514,"whole, the dining room was so small that six people were a tight fit,",Little Women
514,and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of,Little Women
514,precipitating both servants and china pell-mell into the coalbin.  But,Little Women
514,once get used to these slight blemishes and nothing could be more,Little Women
514,"complete, for good sense and good taste had presided over the",Little Women
514,"furnishing, and the result was highly satisfactory.  There were no",Little Women
514,"marble-topped tables, long mirrors, or lace curtains in the little",Little Women
514,"parlor, but simple furniture, plenty of books, a fine picture or two, a",Little Women
514,"stand of flowers in the bay window, and, scattered all about, the",Little Women
514,pretty gifts which came from friendly hands and were the fairer for the,Little Women
514,loving messages they brought.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,I don't think the Parian Psyche Laurie gave lost any of its beauty,Little Women
514,"because John put up the bracket it stood upon, that any upholsterer",Little Women
514,could have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than Amy's,Little Women
514,"artistic hand, or that any store-room was ever better provided with",Little Women
514,"good wishes, merry words, and happy hopes than that in which Jo and her",Little Women
514,"mother put away Meg's few boxes, barrels, and bundles, and I am morally",Little Women
514,certain that the spandy new kitchen never could have looked so cozy and,Little Women
514,"neat if Hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over,",Little Women
514,and laid the fire all ready for lighting the minute 'Mis.  Brooke came,Little Women
514,home'.  I also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so rich a,Little Women
514,"supply of dusters, holders, and piece bags, for Beth made enough to",Little Women
514,"last till the silver wedding came round, and invented three different",Little Women
514,kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal china.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,People who hire all these things done for them never know what they,Little Women
514,"lose, for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them,",Little Women
514,"and Meg found so many proofs of this that everything in her small nest,",Little Women
514,"from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table, was",Little Women
514,eloquent of home love and tender forethought.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"What happy times they had planning together, what solemn shopping",Little Women
514,"excursions, what funny mistakes they made, and what shouts of laughter",Little Women
514,"arose over Laurie's ridiculous bargains.  In his love of jokes, this",Little Women
514,"young gentleman, though nearly through college, was a much of a boy as",Little Women
514,ever.  His last whim had been to bring with him on his weekly visits,Little Women
514,"some new, useful, and ingenious article for the young housekeeper.  Now",Little Women
514,"a bag of remarkable clothespins, next, a wonderful nutmeg grater which",Little Women
514,"fell to pieces at the first trial, a knife cleaner that spoiled all the",Little Women
514,"knives, or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet and left",Little Women
514,"the dirt, labor-saving soap that took the skin off one's hands,",Little Women
514,infallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the,Little Women
514,"deluded buyer, and every kind of tinware, from a toy savings bank for",Little Women
514,"odd pennies, to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own",Little Women
514,steam with every prospect of exploding in the process.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"In vain Meg begged him to stop.  John laughed at him, and Jo called him",Little Women
514,'Mr. Toodles'.  He was possessed with a mania for patronizing Yankee,Little Women
514,"ingenuity, and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth. So each week",Little Women
514,beheld some fresh absurdity.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Everything was done at last, even to Amy's arranging different colored",Little Women

514,"keep me from getting lazy or homesick,"" answered Meg tranquilly.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Sallie Moffat has four,"" began Amy.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""If Meg had four, the house wouldn't hold them, and master and missis",Little Women
514,"would have to camp in the garden,"" broke in Jo, who, enveloped in a big",Little Women
514,"blue pinafore, was giving the last polish to the door handles.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Sallie isn't a poor man's wife, and many maids are in keeping with her",Little Women
514,"fine establishment.  Meg and John begin humbly, but I have a feeling",Little Women
514,that there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in,Little Women
514,the big one.  It's a great mistake for young girls like Meg to leave,Little Women
514,"themselves nothing to do but dress, give orders, and gossip.  When I",Little Women
514,"was first married, I used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get",Little Women
514,"torn, so that I might have the pleasure of mending them, for I got",Little Women
514,"heartily sick of doing fancywork and tending my pocket handkerchief.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Why didn't you go into the kitchen and make messes, as Sallie says she",Little Women
514,"does to amuse herself, though they never turn out well and the servants",Little Women
514,"laugh at her,"" said Meg.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I did after a while, not to 'mess' but to learn of Hannah how things",Little Women
514,"should be done, that my servants need not laugh at me.  It was play",Little Women
514,"then, but there came a time when I was truly grateful that I not only",Little Women
514,possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little,Little Women
514,"girls, and help myself when I could no longer afford to hire help.  You",Little Women
514,"begin at the other end, Meg, dear, but the lessons you learn now will",Little Women
514,"be of use to you by-and-by when John is a richer man, for the mistress",Little Women
514,"of a house, however splendid, should know how work ought to be done, if",Little Women
514,"she wishes to be well and honestly served.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, Mother, I'm sure of that,"" said Meg, listening respectfully to",Little Women
514,"the little lecture, for the best of women will hold forth upon the all",Little Women
514,"absorbing subject of house keeping.  ""Do you know I like this room most",Little Women
514,"of all in my baby house,"" added Meg, a minute after, as they went",Little Women
514,upstairs and she looked into her well-stored linen closet.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Beth was there, laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves and",Little Women
514,"exulting over the goodly array.  All three laughed as Meg spoke, for",Little Women
514,"that linen closet was a joke.  You see, having said that if Meg married",Little Women
514,"'that Brooke' she shouldn't have a cent of her money, Aunt March was",Little Women
514,rather in a quandary when time had appeased her wrath and made her,Little Women
514,"repent her vow.  She never broke her word, and was much exercised in",Little Women
514,"her mind how to get round it, and at last devised a plan whereby she",Little Women
514,"could satisfy herself.  Mrs. Carrol, Florence's mamma, was ordered to",Little Women
514,"buy, have made, and marked a generous supply of house and table linen,",Little Women
514,"and send it as her present, all of which was faithfully done, but the",Little Women
514,"secret leaked out, and was greatly enjoyed by the family, for Aunt",Little Women
514,"March tried to look utterly unconscious, and insisted that she could",Little Women
514,give nothing but the old-fashioned pearls long promised to the first,Little Women
514,bride.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That's a housewifely taste which I am glad to see.  I had a young",Little Women
514,"friend who set up housekeeping with six sheets, but she had finger",Little Women
514,"bowls for company and that satisfied her,"" said Mrs. March, patting the",Little Women
514,"damask tablecloths, with a truly feminine appreciation of their",Little Women
514,fineness.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I haven't a single finger bowl, but this is a setout that will last me",Little Women

514,everyone began to talk.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Where is John?"" asked Meg anxiously.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Stopped to get the license for tomorrow, ma'am.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Which side won the last match, Teddy?"" inquired Jo, who persisted in",Little Women
514,feeling an interest in manly sports despite her nineteen years.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Ours, of course.  Wish you'd been there to see.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How is the lovely Miss Randal?"" asked Amy with a significant smile.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""More cruel than ever.  Don't you see how I'm pining away?"" and Laurie",Little Women
514,gave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What's the last joke?  Undo the bundle and see, Meg,"" said Beth, eying",Little Women
514,the knobby parcel with curiosity.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves,""",Little Women

514,the girls.,Little Women

514,"""Any time when John is away and you get frightened, Mrs. Meg, just",Little Women
514,"swing that out of the front window, and it will rouse the neighborhood",Little Women
514,"in a jiffy.  Nice thing, isn't it?"" and Laurie gave them a sample of",Little Women
514,its powers that made them cover up their ears.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""There's gratitude for you!  And speaking of gratitude reminds me to",Little Women
514,mention that you may thank Hannah for saving your wedding cake from,Little Women

514,"hadn't defended it manfully I'd have had a pick at it, for it looked",Little Women
514,"like a remarkably plummy one.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,"""No, I don't.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Then don't go and be suspicious.  I only want some money,"" said",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""You are so generous and kind-hearted that you let people borrow, and",Little Women
514,can't say 'No' to anyone.  We heard about Henshaw and all you did for,Little Women

514,said Jo warmly.,Little Women

514,"""Oh, he made a mountain out of a molehill.  You wouldn't have me let",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Of course not, but I don't see the use of your having seventeen",Little Women

514,"thought you'd got over the dandy period, but every now and then it",Little Women
514,"breaks out in a new spot.  Just now it's the fashion to be hideous, to",Little Women
514,"make your head look like a scrubbing brush, wear a strait jacket,",Little Women
514,"orange gloves, and clumping square-toed boots.  If it was cheap",Little Women
514,"ugliness, I'd say nothing, but it costs as much as the other, and I",Little Women
514,"don't get any satisfaction out of it.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie threw back his head, and laughed so heartily at this attack,",Little Women
514,"that the felt hat fell off, and Jo walked on it, which insult only",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't lecture any more, there's a good soul!  I have enough all",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""This unassuming style promotes study, that's why we adopt it,""",Little Women

514,"""By the way, Jo, I think that little Parker is really getting desperate",Little Women

514,"bud, hadn't he?"" added Laurie, in a confidential, elder brotherly tone,",Little Women
514,after a minute's silence.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Of course he had.  We don't want any more marrying in this family for",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""It's a fast age, and I don't know what we are coming to, ma'am. You",Little Women

514,times.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't be alarmed.  I'm not one of the agreeable sort.  Nobody will",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""You won't give anyone a chance,"" said Laurie, with a sidelong glance",Little Women
514,"and a little more color than before in his sunburned face. ""You won't",Little Women
514,"show the soft side of your character, and if a fellow gets a peep at it",Little Women
514,"by accident and can't help showing that he likes it, you treat him as",Little Women

514,THE FIRST WEDDING,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,The June roses over the porch were awake bright and early on that,Little Women
514,"morning, rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless sunshine,",Little Women
514,"like friendly little neighbors, as they were.  Quite flushed with",Little Women
514,"excitement were their ruddy faces, as they swung in the wind,",Little Women
514,"whispering to one another what they had seen, for some peeped in at the",Little Women
514,"dining room windows where the feast was spread, some climbed up to nod",Little Women
514,"and smile at the sisters as they dressed the bride, others waved a",Little Women
514,"welcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden, porch,",Little Women
514,"and hall, and all, from the rosiest full-blown flower to the palest",Little Women
514,"baby bud, offered their tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle",Little Women
514,mistress who had loved and tended them so long.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg looked very like a rose herself, for all that was best and sweetest",Little Women
514,"in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day, making it",Little Women
514,"fair and tender, with a charm more beautiful than beauty. Neither silk,",Little Women
514,"lace, nor orange flowers would she have.  ""I don't want a fashionable",Little Women
514,"wedding, but only those about me whom I love, and to them I wish to",Little Women
514,"look and be my familiar self.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"So she made her wedding gown herself, sewing into it the tender hopes",Little Women
514,and innocent romances of a girlish heart.  Her sisters braided up her,Little Women
514,"pretty hair, and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the",Little Women
514,"valley, which 'her John' liked best of all the flowers that grew.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You do look just like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet and lovely",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Then I am satisfied.  But please hug and kiss me, everyone, and don't",Little Women
514,mind my dress.  I want a great many crumples of this sort put into it,Little Women
514,"today,""  and Meg opened her arms to her sisters, who clung about her",Little Women
514,"with April faces for a minute, feeling that the new love had not",Little Women
514,changed the old.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Now I'm going to tie John's cravat for him, and then to stay a few",Little Women
514,"minutes with Father quietly in the study,""  and Meg ran down to perform",Little Women
514,"these little ceremonies, and then to follow her mother wherever she",Little Women
514,"went, conscious that in spite of the smiles on the motherly face, there",Little Women
514,was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the,Little Women
514,first bird from the nest.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As the younger girls stand together, giving the last touches to their",Little Women
514,"simple toilet, it may be a good time to tell of a few changes which",Little Women
514,"three years have wrought in their appearance, for all are looking their",Little Women
514,best just now.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo's angles are much softened, she has learned to carry herself with",Little Women
514,"ease, if not grace.  The curly crop has lengthened into a thick coil,",Little Women
514,more becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure.  There is a,Little Women
514,"fresh collar in her brown cheeks, a soft shine in her eyes, and only",Little Women
514,gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Beth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever.  The beautiful,",Little Women
514,"kind eyes are larger, and in them lies an expression that saddens one,",Little Women
514,although it is not sad itself.  It is the shadow of pain which touches,Little Women
514,"the young face with such pathetic patience, but Beth seldom complains",Little Women
514,and always speaks hopefully of 'being better soon'.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Amy is with truth considered 'the flower of the family', for at sixteen",Little Women
514,"she has the air and bearing of a full-grown woman, not beautiful, but",Little Women
514,possessed of that indescribable charm called grace. One saw it in the,Little Women
514,"lines of her figure, the make and motion of her hands, the flow of her",Little Women
514,"dress, the droop of her hair, unconscious yet harmonious, and as",Little Women
514,"attractive to many as beauty itself.  Amy's nose still afflicted her,",Little Women
514,"for it never would grow Grecian, so did her mouth, being too wide, and",Little Women
514,having a decided chin.  These offending features gave character to her,Little Women
514,"whole face, but she never could see it, and consoled herself with her",Little Women
514,"wonderfully fair complexion, keen blue eyes, and curls more golden and",Little Women
514,abundant than ever.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,All three wore suits of thin silver gray (their best gowns for the,Little Women

514,romance of womanhood.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"There were to be no ceremonious performances, everything was to be as",Little Women

514,"to find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had fallen down, and",Little Women
514,to catch a glimpse of the paternal minister marching upstairs with a,Little Women
514,grave countenance and a wine bottle under each arm.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Upon my word, here's a state of things!"" cried the old lady, taking",Little Women
514,"the seat of honor prepared for her, and settling the folds of her",Little Women

514,"last minute, child.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm not a show, Aunty, and no one is coming to stare at me, to",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Mr. Brooke didn't even say, ""Thank you,"" but as he stooped for the",Little Women
514,"unromantic tool, he kissed his little bride behind the folding door,",Little Women
514,with a look that made Aunt March whisk out her pocket handkerchief with,Little Women
514,a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"A crash, a cry, and a laugh from Laurie, accompanied by the indecorous",Little Women
514,"exclamation, ""Jupiter Ammon!  Jo's upset the cake again!"" caused a",Little Women
514,"momentary flurry, which was hardly over when a flock of cousins",Little Women
514,"arrived, and 'the party came in', as Beth used to say when a child.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't let that young giant come near me, he worries me worse than",Little Women
514,"mosquitoes,"" whispered the old lady to Amy, as the rooms filled and",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""He has promised to be very good today, and he can be perfectly elegant",Little Women
514,"if he likes,"" returned Amy, and gliding away to warn Hercules to beware",Little Women
514,"of the dragon, which warning caused him to haunt the old lady with a",Little Women
514,devotion that nearly distracted her.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"There was no bridal procession, but a sudden silence fell upon the room",Little Women

514,"The fatherly voice broke more than once, which only seemed to make the",Little Women
514,service more beautiful and solemn.  The bridegroom's hand trembled,Little Women

514,"her husband's eyes, and said, ""I will!"" with such tender trust in her",Little Women
514,own face and voice that her mother's heart rejoiced and Aunt March,Little Women

514,"Jo did not cry, though she was very near it once, and was only saved",Little Women
514,from a demonstration by the consciousness that Laurie was staring,Little Women
514,"fixedly at her, with a comical mixture of merriment and emotion in his",Little Women
514,"wicked black eyes.  Beth kept her face hidden on her mother's shoulder,",Little Women
514,"but Amy stood like a graceful statue, with a most becoming ray of",Little Women
514,sunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It wasn't at all the thing, I'm afraid, but the minute she was fairly",Little Women
514,"married, Meg cried, ""The first kiss for Marmee!"" and turning, gave it",Little Women
514,with her heart on her lips.  During the next fifteen minutes she looked,Little Women
514,"more like a rose than ever, for everyone availed themselves of their",Little Women
514,"privileges to the fullest extent, from Mr. Laurence to old Hannah, who,",Little Women
514,"adorned with a headdress fearfully and wonderfully made, fell upon her",Little Women
514,"in the hall, crying with a sob and a chuckle, ""Bless you, deary, a",Little Women
514,"hundred times!  The cake ain't hurt a mite, and everything looks",Little Women
514,"lovely.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Everybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant, or tried",Little Women
514,"to, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when hearts are",Little Women
514,"light.  There was no display of gifts, for they were already in the",Little Women
514,"little house, nor was there an elaborate breakfast, but a plentiful",Little Women
514,"lunch of cake and fruit, dressed with flowers. Mr. Laurence and Aunt",Little Women
514,"March shrugged and smiled at one another when water, lemonade, and",Little Women
514,coffee were found to be to only sorts of nectar which the three Hebes,Little Women
514,"carried round.  No one said anything, till Laurie, who insisted on",Little Women
514,"serving the bride, appeared before her, with a loaded salver in his",Little Women
514,hand and a puzzled expression on his face.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident?"" he whispered, ""or am I",Little Women
514,merely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying about loose this,Little Women
514,"morning?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, your grandfather kindly offered us his best, and Aunt March",Little Women
514,"actually sent some, but Father put away a little for Beth, and",Little Women
514,dispatched the rest to the Soldier's Home.  You know he thinks that,Little Women
514,"wine should be used only in illness, and Mother says that neither she",Little Women
514,"nor her daughters will ever offer it to any young man under her roof.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg spoke seriously and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh, but he",Little Women
514,"did neither, for after a quick look at her, he said, in his impetuous",Little Women
514,"way, ""I like that!  For I've seen enough harm done to wish other women",Little Women
514,"would think as you do.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You are not made wise by experience, I hope?"" and there was an anxious",Little Women
514,accent in Meg's voice.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No.  I give you my word for it.  Don't think too well of me, either,",Little Women
514,this is not one of my temptations.  Being brought up where wine is as,Little Women
514,"common as water and almost as harmless, I don't care for it, but when a",Little Women
514,"pretty girl offers it, one doesn't like to refuse, you see.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""But you will, for the sake of others, if not for your own. Come,",Little Women
514,"Laurie, promise, and give me one more reason to call this the happiest",Little Women
514,"day of my life.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"A demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment,",Little Women
514,for ridicule is often harder to bear than self-denial. Meg knew that if,Little Women
514,"he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs, and feeling her",Little Women
514,"power, used it as a woman may for her friend's good. She did not speak,",Little Women
514,"but she looked up at him with a face made very eloquent by happiness,",Little Women
514,"and a smile which said, ""No one can refuse me anything today.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie certainly could not, and with an answering smile, he gave her",Little Women
514,"his hand, saying heartily, ""I promise, Mrs. Brooke!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I thank you, very, very much.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""And I drink 'long life to your resolution', Teddy,"" cried Jo,",Little Women
514,"baptizing him with a splash of lemonade, as she waved her glass and",Little Women
514,beamed approvingly upon him.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"So the toast was drunk, the pledge made and loyally kept in spite of",Little Women
514,"many temptations, for with instinctive wisdom, the girls seized a happy",Little Women
514,"moment to do their friend a service, for which he thanked them all his",Little Women
514,life.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"After lunch, people strolled about, by twos and threes, through the",Little Women
514,"house and garden, enjoying the sunshine without and within.  Meg and",Little Women
514,"John happened to be standing together in the middle of the grass plot,",Little Women
514,when Laurie was seized with an inspiration which put the finishing,Little Women
514,touch to this unfashionable wedding.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""All the married people take hands and dance round the new-made husband",Little Women
514,"and wife, as the Germans do, while we bachelors and spinsters prance in",Little Women
514,"couples outside!"" cried Laurie, promenading down the path with Amy,",Little Women
514,with such infectious spirit and skill that everyone else followed their,Little Women
514,"example without a murmur.  Mr. and Mrs. March, Aunt and Uncle Carrol",Little Women
514,"began it, others rapidly joined in, even Sallie Moffat, after a",Little Women
514,"moment's hesitation, threw her train over her arm and whisked Ned into",Little Women
514,"the ring.  But the crowning joke was Mr. Laurence and Aunt March, for",Little Women
514,"when the stately old gentleman chasseed solemnly up to the old lady,",Little Women
514,"she just tucked her cane under her arm, and hopped briskly away to join",Little Women
514,"hands with the rest and dance about the bridal pair, while the young",Little Women
514,folks pervaded the garden like butterflies on a midsummer day.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close, and then people",Little Women
514,began to go.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I wish you well, my dear, I heartily wish you well, but I think you'll",Little Women
514,"be sorry for it,"" said Aunt March to Meg, adding to the bridegroom, as",Little Women
514,"he led her to the carriage, ""You've got a treasure, young man, see that",Little Women
514,"you deserve it.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That is the prettiest wedding I've been to for an age, Ned, and I",Little Women
514,"don't see why, for there wasn't a bit of style about it,"" observed Mrs.",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Laurie, my lad, if you ever want to indulge in this sort of thing, get",Little Women

514,"satisfied,"" said Mr. Laurence, settling himself in his easy chair to",Little Women
514,rest after the excitement of the morning.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll do my best to gratify you, Sir,"" was Laurie's unusually dutiful",Little Women
514,"reply, as he carefully unpinned the posy Jo had put in his buttonhole.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The little house was not far away, and the only bridal journey Meg had",Little Women
514,was the quiet walk with John from the old home to the new. When she,Little Women
514,"came down, looking like a pretty Quakeress in her dove-colored suit and",Little Women
514,"straw bonnet tied with white, they all gathered about her to say",Little Women

514,,Little Women

514,"and expect to keep my old place in all your hearts, though I am",Little Women
514,"married.  Beth is going to be with me a great deal, and the other girls",Little Women

514,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,ARTISTIC ATTEMPTS,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,It takes people a long time to learn the difference between talent and,Little Women
514,"genius, especially ambitious young men and women.  Amy was learning",Little Women
514,"this distinction through much tribulation, for mistaking enthusiasm for",Little Women
514,"inspiration, she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity.",Little Women
514,"For a long time there was a lull in the 'mud-pie' business, and she",Little Women
514,"devoted herself to the finest pen-and-ink drawing, in which she showed",Little Women
514,such taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant,Little Women
514,and profitable.  But over-strained eyes caused pen and ink to be laid,Little Women
514,"aside for a bold attempt at poker-sketching. While this attack lasted,",Little Women
514,"the family lived in constant fear of a conflagration, for the odor of",Little Women
514,"burning wood pervaded the house at all hours, smoke issued from attic",Little Women
514,"and shed with alarming frequency, red-hot pokers lay about",Little Women
514,"promiscuously, and Hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and",Little Women
514,the dinner bell at her door in case of fire.  Raphael's face was found,Little Women
514,"boldly executed on the underside of the moulding board, and Bacchus on",Little Women
514,the head of a beer barrel.  A chanting cherub adorned the cover of the,Little Women
514,"sugar bucket, and attempts to portray Romeo and Juliet supplied",Little Women
514,kindling for some time.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"From fire to oil was a natural transition for burned fingers, and Amy",Little Women
514,fell to painting with undiminished ardor.  An artist friend fitted her,Little Women
514,"out with his castoff palettes, brushes, and colors, and she daubed",Little Women
514,"away, producing pastoral and marine views such as were never seen on",Little Women
514,land or sea.  Her monstrosities in the way of cattle would have taken,Little Women
514,"prizes at an agricultural fair, and the perilous pitching of her",Little Women
514,"vessels would have produced seasickness in the most nautical observer,",Little Women
514,if the utter disregard to all known rules of shipbuilding and rigging,Little Women
514,had not convulsed him with laughter at the first glance.  Swarthy boys,Little Women
514,"and dark-eyed Madonnas, staring at you from one corner of the studio,",Little Women
514,suggested Murillo; oily brown shadows of faces with a lurid streak in,Little Women
514,"the wrong place, meant Rembrandt; buxom ladies and dropiscal infants,",Little Women
514,"Rubens; and Turner appeared in tempests of blue thunder, orange",Little Women
514,"lightning, brown rain, and purple clouds, with a tomato-colored splash",Little Women
514,"in the middle, which might be the sun or a bouy, a sailor's shirt or a",Little Women
514,"king's robe, as the spectator pleased.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Charcoal portraits came next, and the entire family hung in a row,",Little Women
514,looking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coalbin. Softened,Little Women
514,"into crayon sketches, they did better, for the likenesses were good,",Little Women
514,"and Amy's hair, Jo's nose, Meg's mouth, and Laurie's eyes were",Little Women
514,"pronounced 'wonderfully fine'.  A return to clay and plaster followed,",Little Women
514,"and ghostly casts of her acquaintances haunted corners of the house, or",Little Women
514,tumbled off closet shelves onto people's heads.  Children were enticed,Little Women
514,"in as models, till their incoherent accounts of her mysterious doings",Little Women
514,caused Miss Amy to be regarded in the light of a young ogress.  Her,Little Women
514,"efforts in this line, however, were brought to an abrupt close by an",Little Women
514,"untoward accident, which quenched her ardor.  Other models failing her",Little Women
514,"for a time, she undertook to cast her own pretty foot, and the family",Little Women
514,were one day alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming and running,Little Women
514,"to the rescue, found the young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed",Little Women
514,"with her foot held fast in a pan full of plaster, which had hardened",Little Women
514,with unexpected rapidity.  With much difficulty and some danger she was,Little Women
514,"dug out, for Jo was so overcome with laughter while she excavated that",Little Women
514,"her knife went too far, cut the poor foot, and left a lasting memorial",Little Women
514,"of one artistic attempt, at least.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"After this Amy subsided, till a mania for sketching from nature set her",Little Women
514,"to haunting river, field, and wood, for picturesque studies, and",Little Women
514,sighing for ruins to copy.  She caught endless colds sitting on damp,Little Women
514,"grass to book 'a delicious bit', composed of a stone, a stump, one",Little Women
514,"mushroom, and a broken mullein stalk, or 'a heavenly mass of clouds',",Little Women
514,that looked like a choice display of featherbeds when done. She,Little Women
514,sacrificed her complexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun to,Little Women
514,"study light and shade, and got a wrinkle over her nose trying after",Little Women
514,"'points of sight', or whatever the squint-and-string performance is",Little Women
514,called.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"If 'genius is eternal patience', as Michelangelo affirms, Amy had some",Little Women
514,"claim to the divine attribute, for she persevered in spite of all",Little Women
514,"obstacles, failures, and discouragements, firmly believing that in time",Little Women
514,she should do something worthy to be called 'high art'.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She was learning, doing, and enjoying other things, meanwhile, for she",Little Women
514,"had resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman, even if she",Little Women
514,"never became a great artist.  Here she succeeded better, for she was",Little Women
514,"one of those happily created beings who please without effort, make",Little Women
514,"friends everywhere, and take life so gracefully and easily that less",Little Women
514,fortunate souls are tempted to believe that such are born under a lucky,Little Women
514,"star.  Everybody liked her, for among her good gifts was tact.  She had",Little Women
514,"an instinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper, always said the",Little Women
514,"right thing to the right person, did just what suited the time and",Little Women
514,"place, and was so self-possessed that her sisters used to say, ""If Amy",Little Women
514,"went to court without any rehearsal beforehand, she'd know exactly what",Little Women
514,"to do.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"One of her weaknesses was a desire to move in 'our best society',",Little Women
514,"without being quite sure what the best really was.  Money, position,",Little Women
514,"fashionable accomplishments, and elegant manners were most desirable",Little Women
514,"things in her eyes, and she liked to associate with those who possessed",Little Women
514,"them, often mistaking the false for the true, and admiring what was not",Little Women
514,"admirable.  Never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman, she",Little Women
514,"cultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings, so that when the",Little Women
514,opportunity came she might be ready to take the place from which,Little Women
514,poverty now excluded her.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""My lady,"" as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be a genuine",Little Women
514,"lady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money cannot buy",Little Women
514,"refinement of nature, that rank does not always confer nobility, and",Little Women
514,that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I want to ask a favor of you, Mamma,"" Amy said, coming in with an",Little Women
514,important air one day.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, little girl, what is it?"" replied her mother, in whose eyes the",Little Women
514,stately young lady still remained 'the baby'.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Our drawing class breaks up next week, and before the girls separate",Little Women
514,"for the summer, I want to ask them out here for a day.  They are wild",Little Women
514,"to see the river, sketch the broken bridge, and copy some of the things",Little Women
514,"they admire in my book.  They have been very kind to me in many ways,",Little Women
514,"and I am grateful, for they are all rich and I know I am poor, yet they",Little Women
514,"never made any difference.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Why should they?"" and Mrs. March put the question with what the girls",Little Women
514,called her 'Maria Theresa air'.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You know as well as I that it does make a difference with nearly",Little Women
514,"everyone, so don't ruffle up like a dear, motherly hen, when your",Little Women
514,chickens get pecked by smarter birds.  The ugly duckling turned out a,Little Women
514,"swan, you know.""  and Amy smiled without bitterness, for she possessed",Little Women
514,a happy temper and hopeful spirit.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Mrs. March laughed, and smoothed down her maternal pride as she asked,",Little Women
514,"""Well, my swan, what is your plan?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week, to take them",Little Women
514,"for a drive to the places they want to see, a row on the river,",Little Women
514,"perhaps, and make a little artistic fete for them.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That looks feasible.  What do you want for lunch?  Cake, sandwiches,",Little Women
514,"fruit, and coffee will be all that is necessary, I suppose?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, dear, no!  We must have cold tongue and chicken, French chocolate",Little Women
514,"and ice cream, besides.  The girls are used to such things, and I want",Little Women
514,"my lunch to be proper and elegant, though I do work for my living.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How many young ladies are there?"" asked her mother, beginning to look",Little Women
514,sober.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Twelve or fourteen in the class, but I dare say they won't all come.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Bless me, child, you will have to charter an omnibus to carry them",Little Women
514,"about.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Why, Mother, how can you think of such a thing?  Not more than six or",Little Women
514,"eight will probably come, so I shall hire a beach wagon and borrow Mr.",Little Women
514,"Laurence's cherry-bounce."" (Hannah's pronunciation of char-a-banc.)",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""All of this will be expensive, Amy.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not very.  I've calculated the cost, and I'll pay for it myself.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't you think, dear, that as these girls are used to such things,",Little Women
514,"and the best we can do will be nothing new, that some simpler plan",Little Women
514,"would be pleasanter to them, as a change if nothing more, and much",Little Women
514,"better for us than buying or borrowing what we don't need, and",Little Women
514,"attempting a style not in keeping with our circumstances?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""If I can't have it as I like, I don't care to have it at all. I know",Little Women
514,"that I can carry it out perfectly well, if you and the girls will help",Little Women
514,"a little, and I don't see why I can't if I'm willing to pay for it,""",Little Women
514,"said Amy, with the decision which opposition was apt to change into",Little Women
514,obstinacy.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Mrs. March knew that experience was an excellent teacher, and when it",Little Women
514,was possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons which she,Little Women
514,"would gladly have made easier, if they had not objected to taking",Little Women
514,advice as much as they did salts and senna.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Very well, Amy, if your heart is set upon it, and you see your way",Little Women
514,"through without too great an outlay of money, time, and temper, I'll",Little Women
514,"say no more.  Talk it over with the girls, and whichever way you",Little Women
514,"decide, I'll do my best to help you.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Thanks, Mother, you are always so kind."" and away went Amy to lay her",Little Women
514,plan before her sisters.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg agreed at once, and promised her aid, gladly offering anything she",Little Women
514,"possessed, from her little house itself to her very best saltspoons.",Little Women
514,But Jo frowned upon the whole project and would have nothing to do with,Little Women
514,it at first.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Why in the world should you spend your money, worry your family, and",Little Women
514,turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who don't care a,Little Women
514,sixpence for you?  I thought you had too much pride and sense to,Little Women
514,truckle to any mortal woman just because she wears French boots and,Little Women
514,"rides in a coupe,"" said Jo, who, being called from the tragic climax of",Little Women
514,"her novel, was not in the best mood for social enterprises.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I don't truckle, and I hate being patronized as much as you do!""",Little Women
514,"returned Amy indignantly, for the two still jangled when such questions",Little Women
514,"arose. ""The girls do care for me, and I for them, and there's a great",Little Women
514,"deal of kindness and sense and talent among them, in spite of what you",Little Women
514,"call fashionable nonsense.  You don't care to make people like you, to",Little Women
514,"go into good society, and cultivate your manners and tastes.  I do, and",Little Women
514,I mean to make the most of every chance that comes.  You can go through,Little Women
514,"the world with your elbows out and your nose in the air, and call it",Little Women
514,"independence, if you like.  That's not my way.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,When Amy had whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually got the,Little Women
514,"best of it, for she seldom failed to have common sense on her side,",Little Women
514,while Jo carried her love of liberty and hate of conventionalities to,Little Women
514,such an unlimited extent that she naturally found herself worsted in an,Little Women
514,argument.  Amy's definition of Jo's idea of independence was such a,Little Women
514,"good hit that both burst out laughing, and the discussion took a more",Little Women
514,"amiable turn.  Much against her will, Jo at length consented to",Little Women
514,"sacrifice a day to Mrs. Grundy, and help her sister through what she",Little Women
514,regarded as 'a nonsensical business'.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The invitations were sent, nearly all accepted, and the following",Little Women
514,Monday was set apart for the grand event.  Hannah was out of humor,Little Women
514,"because her week's work was deranged, and prophesied that ""ef the",Little Women
514,"washin' and ironin' warn't done reg'lar, nothin' would go well",Little Women
514,"anywheres"".  This hitch in the mainspring of the domestic machinery had",Little Women
514,"a bad effect upon the whole concern, but Amy's motto was 'Nil",Little Women
514,"desperandum', and having made up her mind what to do, she proceeded to",Little Women
514,"do it in spite of all obstacles.  To begin with, Hannah's cooking",Little Women
514,"didn't turn out well.  The chicken was tough, the tongue too salty, and",Little Women
514,the chocolate wouldn't froth properly.  Then the cake and ice cost more,Little Women
514,"than Amy expected, so did the wagon, and various other expenses, which",Little Women
514,"seemed trifling at the outset, counted up rather alarmingly afterward.",Little Women
514,Beth got a cold and took to her bed.  Meg had an unusual number of,Little Women
514,"callers to keep her at home, and Jo was in such a divided state of mind",Little Women
514,"that her breakages, accidents, and mistakes were uncommonly numerous,",Little Women
514,"serious, and trying.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"If it was not fair on Monday, the young ladies were to come on Tuesday,",Little Women
514,an arrangement which aggravated Jo and Hannah to the last degree.  On,Little Women
514,Monday morning the weather was in that undecided state which is more,Little Women
514,"exasperating than a steady pour.  It drizzled a little, shone a little,",Little Women
514,"blew a little, and didn't make up its mind till it was too late for",Little Women
514,"anyone else to make up theirs.  Amy was up at dawn, hustling people out",Little Women
514,"of their beds and through their breakfasts, that the house might be got",Little Women
514,"in order.  The parlor struck her as looking uncommonly shabby, but",Little Women
514,"without stopping to sigh for what she had not, she skillfully made the",Little Women
514,"best of what she had, arranging chairs over the worn places in the",Little Women
514,"carpet, covering stains on the walls with homemade statuary, which gave",Little Women
514,"an artistic air to the room, as did the lovely vases of flowers Jo",Little Women
514,scattered about.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The lunch looked charming, and as she surveyed it, she sincerely hoped",Little Women
514,"it would taste well, and that the borrowed glass, china, and silver",Little Women
514,"would get safely home again.  The carriages were promised, Meg and",Little Women
514,"Mother were all ready to do the honors, Beth was able to help Hannah",Little Women
514,"behind the scenes, Jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an",Little Women
514,"absent mind, and aching head, and a very decided disapproval of",Little Women
514,"everybody and everything would allow, and as she wearily dressed, Amy",Little Women
514,"cheered herself with anticipations of the happy moment when, lunch",Little Women
514,"safely over, she should drive away with her friends for an afternoon of",Little Women
514,"artistic delights, for the 'cherry bounce' and the broken bridge were",Little Women
514,her strong points.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Then came the hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from parlor",Little Women
514,"to porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock.  A smart",Little Women
514,shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young,Little Women
514,"ladies who were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came, and at two the",Little Women
514,exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the,Little Women
514,"perishable portions of the feast, that nothing might be lost.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No doubt about the weather today, they will certainly come, so we must",Little Women
514,"fly round and be ready for them,"" said Amy, as the sun woke her next",Little Women
514,"morning.  She spoke briskly, but in her secret soul she wished she had",Little Women
514,"said nothing about Tuesday, for her interest like her cake was getting",Little Women
514,a little stale.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I can't get any lobsters, so you will have to do without salad today,""",Little Women
514,"said Mr. March, coming in half an hour later, with an expression of",Little Women
514,placid despair.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Use the chicken then, the toughness won't matter in a salad,"" advised",Little Women
514,his wife.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Hannah left it on the kitchen table a minute, and the kittens got at",Little Women
514,"it.  I'm very sorry, Amy,"" added Beth, who was still a patroness of",Little Women
514,cats.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Then I must have a lobster, for tongue alone won't do,"" said Amy",Little Women
514,decidedly.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Shall I rush into town and demand one?"" asked Jo, with the magnanimity",Little Women
514,of a martyr.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You'd come bringing it home under your arm without any paper, just to",Little Women
514,"try me.  I'll go myself,"" answered Amy, whose temper was beginning to",Little Women
514,fail.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel traveling basket, she",Little Women
514,"departed, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit and",Little Women
514,"fit her for the labors of the day.  After some delay, the object of her",Little Women
514,"desire was procured, likewise a bottle of dressing to prevent further",Little Women
514,"loss of time at home, and off she drove again, well pleased with her",Little Women
514,own forethought.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old lady,",Little Women
514,Amy pocketed her veil and beguiled the tedium of the way by trying to,Little Women
514,find out where all her money had gone to.  So busy was she with her,Little Women
514,"card full of refractory figures that she did not observe a newcomer,",Little Women
514,"who entered without stopping the vehicle, till a masculine voice said,",Little Women
514,"""Good morning, Miss March,"" and, looking up, she beheld one of Laurie's",Little Women
514,most elegant college friends.  Fervently hoping that he would get out,Little Women
514,"before she did, Amy utterly ignored the basket at her feet, and",Little Women
514,"congratulating herself that she had on her new traveling dress,",Little Women
514,returned the young man's greeting with her usual suavity and spirit.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"They got on excellently, for Amy's chief care was soon set at rest by",Little Women
514,"learning that the gentleman would leave first, and she was chatting",Little Women
514,"away in a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got out. In",Little Women
514,"stumbling to the door, she upset the basket, and--oh horror!--the",Little Women
514,"lobster, in all its vulgar size and brilliancy, was revealed to the",Little Women
514,highborn eyes of a Tudor!,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""By Jove, she's forgotten her dinner!"" cried the unconscious youth,",Little Women
514,"poking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane, and preparing",Little Women
514,to hand out the basket after the old lady.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Please don't--it's--it's mine,"" murmured Amy, with a face nearly as",Little Women
514,red as her fish.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, really, I beg pardon.  It's an uncommonly fine one, isn't it?""",Little Women
514,"said Tudor, with great presence of mind, and an air of sober interest",Little Women
514,that did credit to his breeding.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Amy recovered herself in a breath, set her basket boldly on the seat,",Little Women
514,"and said, laughing, ""Don't you wish you were to have some of the salad",Little Women
514,"he's going to make, and to see the charming young ladies who are to eat",Little Women
514,"it?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Now that was tact, for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine mind",Little Women
514,were touched.  The lobster was instantly surrounded by a halo of,Little Women
514,"pleasing reminiscences, and curiosity about 'the charming young ladies'",Little Women
514,diverted his mind from the comical mishap.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I suppose he'll laugh and joke over it with Laurie, but I shan't see",Little Women
514,"them, that's a comfort,"" thought Amy, as Tudor bowed and departed.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She did not mention this meeting at home (though she discovered that,",Little Women
514,"thanks to the upset, her new dress was much damaged by the rivulets of",Little Women
514,"dressing that meandered down the skirt), but went through with the",Little Women
514,"preparations which now seemed more irksome than before, and at twelve",Little Women
514,o'clock all was ready again.  Feeling that the neighbors were,Little Women
514,"interested in her movements, she wished to efface the memory of",Little Women
514,"yesterday's failure by a grand success today, so she ordered the",Little Women
514,"'cherry bounce', and drove away in state to meet and escort her guests",Little Women
514,to the banquet.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""There's the rumble, they're coming!  I'll go onto the porch and meet",Little Women
514,"them.  It looks hospitable, and I want the poor child to have a good",Little Women
514,"time after all her trouble,"" said Mrs. March, suiting the action to the",Little Women
514,"word.  But after one glance, she retired, with an indescribable",Little Women
514,"expression, for looking quite lost in the big carriage, sat Amy and one",Little Women
514,young lady.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Run, Beth, and help Hannah clear half the things off the table. It",Little Women
514,"will be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single girl,""",Little Women
514,"cried Jo, hurrying away to the lower regions, too excited to stop even",Little Women
514,for a laugh.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"In came Amy, quite calm and delightfully cordial to the one guest who",Little Women
514,"had kept her promise.  The rest of the family, being of a dramatic",Little Women
514,"turn, played their parts equally well, and Miss Eliott found them a",Little Women
514,"most hilarious set, for it was impossible to control entirely the",Little Women
514,merriment which possessed them.  The remodeled lunch being gaily,Little Women
514,"partaken of, the studio and garden visited, and art discussed with",Little Women
514,"enthusiasm, Amy ordered a buggy (alas for the elegant cherry-bounce),",Little Women
514,"and drove her friend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset, when",Little Women
514,'the party went out'.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As she came walking in, looking very tired but as composed as ever, she",Little Women
514,"observed that every vestige of the unfortunate fete had disappeared,",Little Women
514,except a suspicious pucker about the corners of Jo's mouth.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You've had a lovely afternoon for your drive, dear,"" said her mother,",Little Women
514,as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Miss Eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself, I",Little Women
514,"thought,"" observed Beth, with unusual warmth.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Could you spare me some of your cake?  I really need some, I have so",Little Women
514,"much company, and I can't make such delicious stuff as yours,"" asked",Little Women
514,Meg soberly.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Take it all.  I'm the only one here who likes sweet things, and it",Little Women
514,"will mold before I can dispose of it,"" answered Amy, thinking with a",Little Women
514,sigh of the generous store she had laid in for such an end as this.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's a pity Laurie isn't here to help us,"" began Jo, as they sat down",Little Women
514,to ice cream and salad for the second time in two days.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"A warning look from her mother checked any further remarks, and the",Little Women
514,"whole family ate in heroic silence, till Mr. March mildly observed,",Little Women
514,"""salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients, and Evelyn...""",Little Women
514,"Here a general explosion of laughter cut short the 'history of salads',",Little Women
514,to the great surprise of the learned gentleman.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Bundle everything into a basket and send it to the Hummels.  Germans",Little Women
514,"like messes.  I'm sick of the sight of this, and there's no reason you",Little Women

514,wiping her eyes.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I thought I should have died when I saw you two girls rattling about",Little Women
514,"in the what-you-call-it, like two little kernels in a very big",Little Women

514,"Jo, quite spent with laughter.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm very sorry you were disappointed, dear, but we all did our best to",Little Women
514,"satisfy you,"" said Mrs. March, in a tone full of motherly regret.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I am satisfied.  I've done what I undertook, and it's not my fault",Little Women
514,"that it failed.  I comfort myself with that,"" said Amy with a little",Little Women
514,"quiver in her voice.  ""I thank you all very much for helping me, and",Little Women
514,"I'll thank you still more if you won't allude to it for a month, at",Little Women
514,"least.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"No one did for several months, but the word 'fete' always produced a",Little Women

514,CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,LITERARY LESSONS,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Fortune suddenly smiled upon Jo, and dropped a good luck penny in her",Little Women
514,"path.  Not a golden penny, exactly, but I doubt if half a million would",Little Women
514,have given more real happiness then did the little sum that came to her,Little Women
514,in this wise.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room, put on her",Little Women
514,"scribbling suit, and 'fall into a vortex', as she expressed it, writing",Little Women
514,"away at her novel with all her heart and soul, for till that was",Little Women
514,finished she could find no peace.  Her 'scribbling suit' consisted of a,Little Women
514,"black woolen pinafore on which she could wipe her pen at will, and a",Little Women
514,"cap of the same material, adorned with a cheerful red bow, into which",Little Women
514,she bundled her hair when the decks were cleared for action.  This cap,Little Women
514,"was a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her family, who during these",Little Women
514,"periods kept their distance, merely popping in their heads",Little Women
514,"semi-occasionally to ask, with interest, ""Does genius burn, Jo?"" They",Little Women
514,"did not always venture even to ask this question, but took an",Little Women
514,"observation of the cap, and judged accordingly.  If this expressive",Little Women
514,"article of dress was drawn low upon the forehead, it was a sign that",Little Women
514,"hard work was going on, in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly",Little Women
514,"askew, and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off,",Little Women
514,"and cast upon the floor.  At such times the intruder silently withdrew,",Little Women
514,"and not until the red bow was seen gaily erect upon the gifted brow,",Little Women
514,did anyone dare address Jo.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She did not think herself a genius by any means, but when the writing",Little Women
514,"fit came on, she gave herself up to it with entire abandon, and led a",Little Women
514,"blissful life, unconscious of want, care, or bad weather, while she sat",Little Women
514,"safe and happy in an imaginary world, full of friends almost as real",Little Women
514,"and dear to her as any in the flesh.  Sleep forsook her eyes, meals",Little Women
514,"stood untasted, day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness",Little Women
514,"which blessed her only at such times, and made these hours worth",Little Women
514,"living, even if they bore no other fruit.  The divine afflatus usually",Little Women
514,"lasted a week or two, and then she emerged from her 'vortex', hungry,",Little Women
514,"sleepy, cross, or despondent.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,She was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was,Little Women
514,"prevailed upon to escort Miss Crocker to a lecture, and in return for",Little Women
514,"her virtue was rewarded with a new idea.  It was a People's Course, the",Little Women
514,"lecture on the Pyramids, and Jo rather wondered at the choice of such a",Little Women
514,"subject for such an audience, but took it for granted that some great",Little Women
514,social evil would be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding,Little Women
514,the glories of the Pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy,Little Women
514,"with the price of coal and flour, and whose lives were spent in trying",Little Women
514,to solve harder riddles than that of the Sphinx.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"They were early, and while Miss Crocker set the heel of her stocking,",Little Women
514,Jo amused herself by examining the faces of the people who occupied the,Little Women
514,"seat with them.  On her left were two matrons, with massive foreheads",Little Women
514,"and bonnets to match, discussing Women's Rights and making tatting.",Little Women
514,"Beyond sat a pair of humble lovers, artlessly holding each other by the",Little Women
514,"hand, a somber spinster eating peppermints out of a paper bag, and an",Little Women
514,old gentleman taking his preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna.  On,Little Women
514,"her right, her only neighbor was a studious looking lad absorbed in a",Little Women
514,newspaper.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It was a pictorial sheet, and Jo examined the work of art nearest her,",Little Women
514,idly wondering what fortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed,Little Women
514,"the melodramatic illustration of an Indian in full war costume,",Little Women
514,"tumbling over a precipice with a wolf at his throat, while two",Little Women
514,"infuriated young gentlemen, with unnaturally small feet and big eyes,",Little Women
514,"were stabbing each other close by, and a disheveled female was flying",Little Women
514,away in the background with her mouth wide open.  Pausing to turn a,Little Women
514,"page, the lad saw her looking and, with boyish good nature offered half",Little Women
514,"his paper, saying bluntly, ""want to read it? That's a first-rate story.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo accepted it with a smile, for she had never outgrown her liking for",Little Women
514,"lads, and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth of love,",Little Women
514,"mystery, and murder, for the story belonged to that class of light",Little Women
514,"literature in which the passions have a holiday, and when the author's",Little Women
514,"invention fails, a grand catastrophe clears the stage of one half the",Little Women
514,"dramatis personae, leaving the other half to exult over their downfall.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Prime, isn't it?"" asked the boy, as her eye went down the last",Little Women
514,paragraph of her portion.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I think you and I could do as well as that if we tried,"" returned Jo,",Little Women
514,amused at his admiration of the trash.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I should think I was a pretty lucky chap if I could.  She makes a good",Little Women
514,"living out of such stories, they say."" and he pointed to the name of",Little Women
514,"Mrs. S.L.A.N.G.  Northbury, under the title of the tale.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Do you know her?"" asked Jo, with sudden interest.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, but I read all her pieces, and I know a fellow who works in the",Little Women
514,"office where this paper is printed.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this?"" and Jo",Little Women
514,looked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly sprinkled,Little Women
514,exclamation points that adorned the page.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Guess she does!  She knows just what folks like, and gets paid well",Little Women
514,"for writing it.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Here the lecture began, but Jo heard very little of it, for while",Little Women
514,"Professor Sands was prosing away about Belzoni, Cheops, scarabei, and",Little Women
514,"hieroglyphics, she was covertly taking down the address of the paper,",Little Women
514,and boldly resolving to try for the hundred-dollar prize offered in its,Little Women
514,columns for a sensational story.  By the time the lecture ended and the,Little Women
514,"audience awoke, she had built up a splendid fortune for herself (not",Little Women
514,"the first founded on paper), and was already deep in the concoction of",Little Women
514,"her story, being unable to decide whether the duel should come before",Little Women
514,the elopement or after the murder.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She said nothing of her plan at home, but fell to work next day, much",Little Women
514,"to the disquiet of her mother, who always looked a little anxious when",Little Women
514,"'genius took to burning'.  Jo had never tried this style before,",Little Women
514,contenting herself with very mild romances for _The Spread Eagle_.  Her,Little Women
514,"experience and miscellaneous reading were of service now, for they gave",Little Women
514,"her some idea of dramatic effect, and supplied plot, language, and",Little Women
514,costumes.  Her story was as full of desperation and despair as her,Little Women
514,limited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to,Little Women
514,"make it, and having located it in Lisbon, she wound up with an",Little Women
514,"earthquake, as a striking and appropriate denouement.  The manuscript",Little Women
514,"was privately dispatched, accompanied by a note, modestly saying that",Little Women
514,"if the tale didn't get the prize, which the writer hardly dared expect,",Little Women
514,she would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Six weeks is a long time to wait, and a still longer time for a girl to",Little Women
514,"keep a secret, but Jo did both, and was just beginning to give up all",Little Women
514,"hope of ever seeing her manuscript again, when a letter arrived which",Little Women
514,"almost took her breath away, for on opening it, a check for a hundred",Little Women
514,dollars fell into her lap.  For a minute she stared at it as if it had,Little Women
514,"been a snake, then she read her letter and began to cry.  If the",Little Women
514,amiable gentleman who wrote that kindly note could have known what,Little Women
514,"intense happiness he was giving a fellow creature, I think he would",Little Women
514,"devote his leisure hours, if he has any, to that amusement, for Jo",Little Women
514,"valued the letter more than the money, because it was encouraging, and",Little Women
514,after years of effort it was so pleasant to find that she had learned,Little Women
514,"to do something, though it was only to write a sensation story.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"A prouder young woman was seldom seen than she, when, having composed",Little Women
514,"herself, she electrified the family by appearing before them with the",Little Women
514,"letter in one hand, the check in the other, announcing that she had won",Little Women
514,"the prize.  Of course there was a great jubilee, and when the story",Little Women
514,"came everyone read and praised it, though after her father had told her",Little Women
514,"that the language was good, the romance fresh and hearty, and the",Little Women
514,"tragedy quite thrilling, he shook his head, and said in his unworldly",Little Women
514,way...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You can do better than this, Jo.  Aim at the highest, and never mind",Little Women
514,"the money.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I think the money is the best part of it.  What will you do with such",Little Women
514,"a fortune?"" asked Amy, regarding the magic slip of paper with a",Little Women
514,reverential eye.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Send Beth and Mother to the seaside for a month or two,"" answered Jo",Little Women
514,promptly.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"To the seaside they went, after much discussion, and though Beth didn't",Little Women
514,"come home as plump and rosy as could be desired, she was much better,",Little Women
514,while Mrs. March declared she felt ten years younger.  So Jo was,Little Women
514,"satisfied with the investment of her prize money, and fell to work with",Little Women
514,"a cheery spirit, bent on earning more of those delightful checks. She",Little Women
514,"did earn several that year, and began to feel herself a power in the",Little Women
514,"house, for by the magic of a pen, her 'rubbish' turned into comforts",Little Women
514,"for them all.  The Duke's Daughter paid the butcher's bill, A Phantom",Little Women
514,"Hand put down a new carpet, and the Curse of the Coventrys proved the",Little Women
514,blessing of the Marches in the way of groceries and gowns.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Wealth is certainly a most desirable thing, but poverty has its sunny",Little Women
514,"side, and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine",Little Women
514,"satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand, and to the",Little Women
514,"inspiration of necessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and useful",Little Women
514,"blessings of the world.  Jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction, and",Little Women
514,"ceased to envy richer girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge that",Little Women
514,"she could supply her own wants, and need ask no one for a penny.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Little notice was taken of her stories, but they found a market, and",Little Women
514,"encouraged by this fact, she resolved to make a bold stroke for fame",Little Women
514,"and fortune.  Having copied her novel for the fourth time, read it to",Little Women
514,"all her confidential friends, and submitted it with fear and trembling",Little Women
514,"to three publishers, she at last disposed of it, on condition that she",Little Women

514,"""Now I must either bundle it back in to my tin kitchen to mold, pay for",Little Women

514,"of outsiders will prove useful, even if she gets but little money.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes,"" said Jo, knitting her brows, ""that's just it.  I've been fussing",Little Women
514,"over the thing so long, I really don't know whether it's good, bad, or",Little Women
514,"indifferent.  It will be a great help to have cool, impartial persons",Little Women
514,"take a look at it, and tell me what they think of it.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I wouldn't leave a word out of it.  You'll spoil it if you do, for the",Little Women
514,interest of the story is more in the minds than in the actions of the,Little Women
514,"people, and it will be all a muddle if you don't explain as you go on,""",Little Women
514,"said Meg, who firmly believed that this book was the most remarkable",Little Women
514,novel ever written.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""But Mr. Allen says, 'Leave out the explanations, make it brief and",Little Women
514,"dramatic, and let the characters tell the story',"" interrupted Jo,",Little Women
514,turning to the publisher's note.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Do as he tells you.  He knows what will sell, and we don't. Make a",Little Women
514,"good, popular book, and get as much money as you can. By-and-by, when",Little Women
514,"you've got a name, you can afford to digress, and have philosophical",Little Women
514,"and metaphysical people in your novels,"" said Amy, who took a strictly",Little Women
514,practical view of the subject.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well,"" said Jo, laughing, ""if my people are 'philosophical and",Little Women
514,"metaphysical', it isn't my fault, for I know nothing about such things,",Little Women
514,"except what I hear father say, sometimes.  If I've got some of his wise",Little Women
514,"ideas jumbled up with my romance, so much the better for me.  Now,",Little Women
514,"Beth, what do you say?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I should so like to see it printed soon,"" was all Beth said, and",Little Women
514,smiled in saying it.  But there was an unconscious emphasis on the last,Little Women
514,"word, and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their childlike",Little Women
514,"candor, which chilled Jo's heart for a minute with a forboding fear,",Little Women
514,and decided her to make her little venture 'soon'.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"So, with Spartan firmness, the young authoress laid her first-born on",Little Women
514,"her table, and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre.  In the hope of",Little Women
514,"pleasing everyone, she took everyone's advice, and like the old man and",Little Women
514,his donkey in the fable suited nobody.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Her father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got,Little Women
514,"into it, so that was allowed to remain though she had her doubts about",Little Women
514,it.  Her mother thought that there was a trifle too much description.,Little Women
514,"Out, therefore it came, and with it many necessary links in the story.",Little Women
514,"Meg admired the tragedy, so Jo piled up the agony to suit her, while",Little Women
514,"Amy objected to the fun, and, with the best intentions in life, Jo",Little Women
514,quenched the spritly scenes which relieved the somber character of the,Little Women
514,"story.  Then, to complicate the ruin, she cut it down one third, and",Little Women
514,"confidingly sent the poor little romance, like a picked robin, out into",Little Women
514,"the big, busy world to try its fate.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Well, it was printed, and she got three hundred dollars for it,",Little Women
514,"likewise plenty of praise and blame, both so much greater than she",Little Women
514,expected that she was thrown into a state of bewilderment from which it,Little Women
514,took her some time to recover.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You said, Mother, that criticism would help me.  But how can it, when",Little Women
514,it's so contradictory that I don't know whether I've written a,Little Women
514,"promising book or broken all the ten commandments?"" cried poor Jo,",Little Women
514,"turning over a heap of notices, the perusal of which filled her with",Little Women
514,"pride and joy one minute, wrath and dismay the next.  ""This man says,",Little Women
514,"'An exquisite book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness.' 'All is",Little Women
514,"sweet, pure, and healthy.'"" continued the perplexed authoress.  ""The",Little Women
514,"next, 'The theory of the book is bad, full of morbid fancies,",Little Women
514,"spiritualistic ideas, and unnatural characters.' Now, as I had no",Little Women
514,"theory of any kind, don't believe in Spiritualism, and copied my",Little Women
514,"characters from life, I don't see how this critic can be right.",Little Women
514,"Another says, 'It's one of the best American novels which has appeared",Little Women
514,"for years.' (I know better than that), and the next asserts that",Little Women
514,"'Though it is original, and written with great force and feeling, it is",Little Women
514,"a dangerous book.' 'Tisn't!  Some make fun of it, some overpraise, and",Little Women
514,"nearly all insist that I had a deep theory to expound, when I only",Little Women
514,wrote it for the pleasure and the money.  I wish I'd printed the whole,Little Women
514,"or not at all, for I do hate to be so misjudged.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Her family and friends administered comfort and commendation liberally.,Little Women
514,"Yet it was a hard time for sensitive, high-spirited Jo, who meant so",Little Women
514,"well and had apparently done so ill.  But it did her good, for those",Little Women
514,whose opinion had real value gave her the criticism which is an,Little Women
514,"author's best education, and when the first soreness was over, she",Little Women
514,"could laugh at her poor little book, yet believe in it still, and feel",Little Women
514,herself the wiser and stronger for the buffeting she had received.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not being a genius, like Keats, it won't kill me,"" she said stoutly,",Little Women
514,"""and I've got the joke on my side, after all, for the parts that were",Little Women
514,"taken straight out of real life are denounced as impossible and absurd,",Little Women
514,and the scenes that I made up out of my own silly head are pronounced,Little Women

514,DOMESTIC EXPERIENCES,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Like most other young matrons, Meg began her married life with the",Little Women
514,determination to be a model housekeeper.  John should find home a,Little Women
514,"paradise, he should always see a smiling face, should fare sumptuously",Little Women
514,"every day, and never know the loss of a button.  She brought so much",Little Women
514,"love, energy, and cheerfulness to the work that she could not but",Little Women
514,"succeed, in spite of some obstacles.  Her paradise was not a tranquil",Little Women
514,"one, for the little woman fussed, was over-anxious to please, and",Little Women
514,"bustled about like a true Martha, cumbered with many cares.  She was",Little Women
514,"too tired, sometimes, even to smile, John grew dyspeptic after a course",Little Women
514,"of dainty dishes and ungratefully demanded plain fare.  As for buttons,",Little Women
514,"she soon learned to wonder where they went, to shake her head over the",Little Women
514,"carelessness of men, and to threaten to make him sew them on himself,",Little Women
514,and see if his work would stand impatient and clumsy fingers any better,Little Women
514,than hers.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"They were very happy, even after they discovered that they couldn't",Little Women
514,"live on love alone.  John did not find Meg's beauty diminished, though",Little Women
514,she beamed at him from behind the familiar coffee pot.  Nor did Meg,Little Women
514,"miss any of the romance from the daily parting, when her husband",Little Women
514,"followed up his kiss with the tender inquiry, ""Shall I send some veal",Little Women
514,"or mutton for dinner, darling?"" The little house ceased to be a",Little Women
514,"glorified bower, but it became a home, and the young couple soon felt",Little Women
514,"that it was a change for the better.  At first they played keep-house,",Little Women
514,and frolicked over it like children.  Then John took steadily to,Little Women
514,"business, feeling the cares of the head of a family upon his shoulders,",Little Women
514,"and Meg laid by her cambric wrappers, put on a big apron, and fell to",Little Women
514,"work, as before said, with more energy than discretion.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,While the cooking mania lasted she went through Mrs. Cornelius's,Little Women
514,"Receipt Book as if it were a mathematical exercise, working out the",Little Women
514,problems with patience and care.  Sometimes her family were invited in,Little Women
514,"to help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes, or Lotty would be",Little Women
514,"privately dispatched with a batch of failures, which were to be",Little Women
514,concealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little,Little Women
514,Hummels.  An evening with John over the account books usually produced,Little Women
514,"a temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm, and a frugal fit would",Little Women
514,"ensue, during which the poor man was put through a course of bread",Little Women
514,"pudding, hash, and warmed-over coffee, which tried his soul, although",Little Women
514,he bore it with praiseworthy fortitude.  Before the golden mean was,Little Women
514,"found, however, Meg added to her domestic possessions what young",Little Women
514,"couples seldom get on long without, a family jar.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Fired with a housewifely wish to see her storeroom stocked with,Little Women
514,"homemade preserves, she undertook to put up her own currant jelly. John",Little Women
514,was requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots and an extra,Little Women
514,"quantity of sugar, for their own currants were ripe and were to be",Little Women
514,attended to at once.  As John firmly believed that 'my wife' was equal,Little Women
514,"to anything, and took a natural pride in her skill, he resolved that",Little Women
514,"she should be gratified, and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most",Little Women
514,pleasing form for winter use.  Home came four dozen delightful little,Little Women
514,"pots, half a barrel of sugar, and a small boy to pick the currants for",Little Women
514,"her.  With her pretty hair tucked into a little cap, arms bared to the",Little Women
514,"elbow, and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the",Little Women
514,"bib, the young housewife fell to work, feeling no doubts about her",Little Women
514,"success, for hadn't she seen Hannah do it hundreds of times?  The array",Little Women
514,"of pots rather amazed her at first, but John was so fond of jelly, and",Little Women
514,"the nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf, that Meg",Little Women
514,"resolved to fill them all, and spent a long day picking, boiling,",Little Women
514,"straining, and fussing over her jelly.  She did her best, she asked",Little Women
514,"advice of Mrs. Cornelius, she racked her brain to remember what Hannah",Little Women
514,"did that she left undone, she reboiled, resugared, and restrained, but",Little Women
514,that dreadful stuff wouldn't 'jell'.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She longed to run home, bib and all, and ask Mother to lend her a hand,",Little Women
514,but John and she had agreed that they would never annoy anyone with,Little Women
514,"their private worries, experiments, or quarrels.  They had laughed over",Little Women
514,"that last word as if the idea it suggested was a most preposterous one,",Little Women
514,"but they had held to their resolve, and whenever they could get on",Little Women
514,"without help they did so, and no one interfered, for Mrs. March had",Little Women
514,advised the plan.  So Meg wrestled alone with the refractory sweetmeats,Little Women
514,"all that hot summer day, and at five o'clock sat down in her",Little Women
514,"topsy-turvey kitchen, wrung her bedaubed hands, lifted up her voice and",Little Women
514,wept.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Now, in the first flush of the new life, she had often said, ""My",Little Women
514,husband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever he,Little Women
514,"likes.  I shall always be prepared.  There shall be no flurry, no",Little Women
514,"scolding, no discomfort, but a neat house, a cheerful wife, and a good",Little Women
514,"dinner.  John, dear, never stop to ask my leave, invite whom you",Little Women
514,"please, and be sure of a welcome from me.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"How charming that was, to be sure!  John quite glowed with pride to",Little Women
514,"hear her say it, and felt what a blessed thing it was to have a",Little Women
514,"superior wife.  But, although they had had company from time to time,",Little Women
514,"it never happened to be unexpected, and Meg had never had an",Little Women
514,opportunity to distinguish herself till now.  It always happens so in,Little Women
514,"this vale of tears, there is an inevitability about such things which",Little Women
514,"we can only wonder at, deplore, and bear as we best can.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"If John had not forgotten all about the jelly, it really would have",Little Women
514,"been unpardonable in him to choose that day, of all the days in the",Little Women
514,"year, to bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly.  Congratulating",Little Women
514,"himself that a handsome repast had been ordered that morning, feeling",Little Women
514,"sure that it would be ready to the minute, and indulging in pleasant",Little Women
514,"anticipations of the charming effect it would produce, when his pretty",Little Women
514,"wife came running out to meet him, he escorted his friend to his",Little Women
514,"mansion, with the irrepressible satisfaction of a young host and",Little Women
514,husband.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It is a world of disappointments, as John discovered when he reached",Little Women
514,the Dovecote.  The front door usually stood hospitably open. Now it was,Little Women
514,"not only shut, but locked, and yesterday's mud still adorned the steps.",Little Women
514,"The parlor windows were closed and curtained, no picture of the pretty",Little Women
514,"wife sewing on the piazza, in white, with a distracting little bow in",Little Women
514,"her hair, or a bright-eyed hostess, smiling a shy welcome as she",Little Women
514,"greeted her guest.  Nothing of the sort, for not a soul appeared but a",Little Women
514,sanginary-looking boy asleep under the current bushes.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm afraid something has happened.  Step into the garden, Scott, while",Little Women
514,"I look up Mrs. Brooke,"" said John, alarmed at the silence and solitude.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Round the house he hurried, led by a pungent smell of burned sugar, and",Little Women
514,"Mr. Scott strolled after him, with a queer look on his face.  He paused",Little Women
514,"discreetly at a distance when Brooke disappeared, but he could both see",Little Women
514,"and hear, and being a bachelor, enjoyed the prospect mightily.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,In the kitchen reigned confusion and despair.  One edition of jelly was,Little Women
514,"trickled from pot to pot, another lay upon the floor, and a third was",Little Women
514,"burning gaily on the stove.  Lotty, with Teutonic phlegm, was calmly",Little Women
514,"eating bread and currant wine, for the jelly was still in a hopelessly",Little Women
514,"liquid state, while Mrs. Brooke, with her apron over her head, sat",Little Women
514,sobbing dismally.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""My dearest girl, what is the matter?"" cried John, rushing in, with",Little Women
514,"awful visions of scalded hands, sudden news of affliction, and secret",Little Women
514,consternation at the thought of the guest in the garden.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, John, I am so tired and hot and cross and worried!  I've been at",Little Women
514,"it till I'm all worn out.  Do come and help me or I shall die!"" and the",Little Women
514,"exhausted housewife cast herself upon his breast, giving him a sweet",Little Women
514,"welcome in every sense of the word, for her pinafore had been baptized",Little Women
514,at the same time as the floor.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What worries you dear?  Has anything dreadful happened?"" asked the",Little Women
514,"anxious John, tenderly kissing the crown of the little cap, which was",Little Women
514,all askew.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes,"" sobbed Meg despairingly.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Tell me quick, then.  Don't cry.  I can bear anything better than",Little Women
514,"that.  Out with it, love.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""The... The jelly won't jell and I don't know what to do!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"John Brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward, and the",Little Women
514,"derisive Scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty peal, which",Little Women
514,put the finishing stroke to poor Meg's woe.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Is that all?  Fling it out of the window, and don't bother any more",Little Women
514,"about it.  I'll buy you quarts if you want it, but for heaven's sake",Little Women
514,"don't have hysterics, for I've brought Jack Scott home to dinner,",Little Women
514,"and...""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"John got no further, for Meg cast him off, and clasped her hands with a",Little Women
514,"tragic gesture as she fell into a chair, exclaiming in a tone of",Little Women
514,"mingled indignation, reproach, and dismay...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""A man to dinner, and everything in a mess!  John Brooke, how could you",Little Women
514,"do such a thing?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Hush, he's in the garden!  I forgot the confounded jelly, but it can't",Little Women
514,"be helped now,"" said John, surveying the prospect with an anxious eye.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You ought to have sent word, or told me this morning, and you ought to",Little Women
514,"have remembered how busy I was,"" continued Meg petulantly, for even",Little Women
514,turtledoves will peck when ruffled.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I didn't know it this morning, and there was no time to send word, for",Little Women
514,"I met him on the way out.  I never thought of asking leave, when you",Little Women
514,"have always told me to do as I liked.  I never tried it before, and",Little Women
514,"hang me if I ever do again!"" added John, with an aggrieved air.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I should hope not!  Take him away at once.  I can't see him, and there",Little Women
514,"isn't any dinner.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, I like that!  Where's the beef and vegetables I sent home, and",Little Women
514,"the pudding you promised?"" cried John, rushing to the larder.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I hadn't time to cook anything.  I meant to dine at Mother's. I'm",Little Women
514,"sorry, but I was so busy,"" and Meg's tears began again.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"John was a mild man, but he was human, and after a long day's work to",Little Women
514,"come home tired, hungry, and hopeful, to find a chaotic house, an empty",Little Women
514,"table, and a cross wife was not exactly conducive to repose of mind or",Little Women
514,"manner.  He restrained himself however, and the little squall would",Little Women
514,"have blown over, but for one unlucky word.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's a scrape, I acknowledge, but if you will lend a hand, we'll pull",Little Women
514,"through and have a good time yet.  Don't cry, dear, but just exert",Little Women
514,"yourself a bit, and fix us up something to eat.  We're both as hungry",Little Women
514,"as hunters, so we shan't mind what it is.  Give us the cold meat, and",Little Women
514,"bread and cheese.  We won't ask for jelly.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He meant it to be a good-natured joke, but that one word sealed his",Little Women
514,"fate.  Meg thought it was too cruel to hint about her sad failure, and",Little Women
514,the last atom of patience vanished as he spoke.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You must get yourself out of the scrape as you can.  I'm too used up",Little Women
514,to 'exert' myself for anyone.  It's like a man to propose a bone and,Little Women
514,vulgar bread and cheese for company.  I won't have anything of the sort,Little Women
514,"in my house.  Take that Scott up to Mother's, and tell him I'm away,",Little Women
514,"sick, dead, anything.  I won't see him, and you two can laugh at me and",Little Women

514,"Scott was not taken 'up to Mother's', and when Meg descended, after",Little Women
514,"they had strolled away together, she found traces of a promiscuous",Little Women

514,"short-comings, of loyalty to John, ""who might be cruel, but nobody",Little Women
514,"should know it,"" restrained her, and after a summary cleaning up, she",Little Women
514,"dressed herself prettily, and sat down to wait for John to come and be",Little Women
514,forgiven.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Unfortunately, John didn't come, not seeing the matter in that light.",Little Women

514,"friend enjoyed the impromptu dinner, and promised to come again, but",Little Women
514,"John was angry, though he did not show it, he felt that Meg had",Little Women
514,"deserted him in his hour of need.  ""It wasn't fair to tell a man to",Little Women
514,"bring folks home any time, with perfect freedom, and when he took you",Little Women
514,"at your word, to flame up and blame him, and leave him in the lurch, to",Little Women
514,"be laughed at or pitied.  No, by George, it wasn't! And Meg must know",Little Women
514,"it.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He had fumed inwardly during the feast, but when the flurry was over",Little Women
514,"and he strolled home after seeing Scott off, a milder mood came over",Little Women
514,"him.  ""Poor little thing!  It was hard upon her when she tried so",Little Women
514,"heartily to please me.  She was wrong, of course, but then she was",Little Women
514,"young.  I must be patient and teach her.""  He hoped she had not gone",Little Women
514,home--he hated gossip and interference.  For a minute he was ruffled,Little Women
514,"again at the mere thought of it, and then the fear that Meg would cry",Little Women
514,"herself sick softened his heart, and sent him on at a quicker pace,",Little Women
514,"resolving to be calm and kind, but firm, quite firm, and show her where",Little Women
514,she had failed in her duty to her spouse.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg likewise resolved to be 'calm and kind, but firm', and show him his",Little Women
514,"duty.  She longed to run to meet him, and beg pardon, and be kissed and",Little Women
514,"comforted, as she was sure of being, but, of course, she did nothing of",Little Women
514,"the sort, and when she saw John coming, began to hum quite naturally,",Little Women
514,"as she rocked and sewed, like a lady of leisure in her best parlor.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"John was a little disappointed not to find a tender Niobe, but feeling",Little Women
514,"that his dignity demanded the first apology, he made none, only came",Little Women
514,leisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the singularly,Little Women
514,"relevant remark, ""We are going to have a new moon, my dear.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I've no objection,"" was Meg's equally soothing remark.  A few other",Little Women
514,topics of general interest were introduced by Mr. Brooke and,Little Women
514,"wet-blanketed by Mrs. Brooke, and conversation languished.  John went",Little Women
514,"to one window, unfolded his paper, and wrapped himself in it,",Little Women
514,"figuratively speaking.  Meg went to the other window, and sewed as if",Little Women
514,new rosettes for slippers were among the necessaries of life. Neither,Little Women
514,"spoke.  Both looked quite 'calm and firm', and both felt desperately",Little Women
514,uncomfortable.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, dear,"" thought Meg, ""married life is very trying, and does need",Little Women

514,"He is very accurate, and particular about the truth--a good trait,",Little Women
514,"though you call him 'fussy'. Never deceive him by look or word, Meg,",Little Women
514,"and he will give you the confidence you deserve, the support you need.",Little Women
514,"He has a temper, not like ours--one flash and then all over--but the",Little Women
514,"white, still anger that is seldom stirred, but once kindled is hard to",Little Women
514,"quench.  Be careful, be very careful, not to wake his anger against",Little Women
514,"yourself, for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect.  Watch",Little Women
514,"yourself, be the first to ask pardon if you both err, and guard against",Little Women
514,"the little piques, misunderstandings, and hasty words that often pave",Little Women
514,"the way for bitter sorrow and regret.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"These words came back to Meg, as she sat sewing in the sunset,",Little Women
514,"especially the last.  This was the first serious disagreement, her own",Little Women
514,"hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind, as she recalled them, her",Little Women
514,"own anger looked childish now, and thoughts of poor John coming home to",Little Women
514,such a scene quite melted her heart.  She glanced at him with tears in,Little Women
514,"her eyes, but he did not see them.  She put down her work and got up,",Little Women
514,"thinking, ""I will be the first to say, 'Forgive me'"", but he did not",Little Women
514,"seem to hear her.  She went very slowly across the room, for pride was",Little Women
514,"hard to swallow, and stood by him, but he did not turn his head.  For a",Little Women
514,"minute she felt as if she really couldn't do it, then came the thought,",Little Women
514,"""This is the beginning. I'll do my part, and have nothing to reproach",Little Women
514,"myself with,"" and stooping down, she softly kissed her husband on the",Little Women
514,forehead. Of course that settled it.  The penitent kiss was better than,Little Women
514,"a world of words, and John had her on his knee in a minute, saying",Little Women
514,tenderly...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly pots. Forgive me,",Little Women
514,"dear.  I never will again!""",Little Women

514,"But he did, oh bless you, yes, hundreds of times, and so did Meg, both",Little Women
514,"declaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made, for family",Little Women
514,peace was preserved in that little family jar.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"After this, Meg had Mr. Scott to dinner by special invitation, and",Little Women
514,served him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the first,Little Women
514,"course, on which occasion she was so gay and gracious, and made",Little Women
514,"everything go off so charmingly, that Mr. Scott told John he was a",Little Women
514,"lucky fellow, and shook his head over the hardships of bachelorhood all",Little Women
514,the way home.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"In the autumn, new trials and experiences came to Meg.  Sallie Moffat",Little Women
514,"renewed her friendship, was always running out for a dish of gossip at",Little Women
514,"the little house, or inviting 'that poor dear' to come in and spend the",Little Women
514,"day at the big house.  It was pleasant, for in dull weather Meg often",Little Women
514,"felt lonely.  All were busy at home, John absent till night, and",Little Women
514,"nothing to do but sew, or read, or potter about.  So it naturally fell",Little Women
514,out that Meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with her friend.,Little Women
514,"Seeing Sallie's pretty things made her long for such, and pity herself",Little Women
514,"because she had not got them.  Sallie was very kind, and often offered",Little Women
514,"her the coveted trifles, but Meg declined them, knowing that John",Little Women
514,"wouldn't like it, and then this foolish little woman went and did what",Little Women
514,John disliked even worse.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She knew her husband's income, and she loved to feel that he trusted",Little Women
514,"her, not only with his happiness, but what some men seem to value",Little Women
514,"more--his money.  She knew where it was, was free to take what she",Little Women
514,"liked, and all he asked was that she should keep account of every",Little Women
514,"penny, pay bills once a month, and remember that she was a poor man's",Little Women
514,"wife.  Till now she had done well, been prudent and exact, kept her",Little Women
514,"little account books neatly, and showed them to him monthly without",Little Women
514,"fear.  But that autumn the serpent got into Meg's paradise, and tempted",Little Women
514,"her like many a modern Eve, not with apples, but with dress.  Meg",Little Women
514,"didn't like to be pitied and made to feel poor.  It irritated her, but",Little Women
514,"she was ashamed to confess it, and now and then she tried to console",Little Women
514,"herself by buying something pretty, so that Sallie needn't think she",Little Women
514,"had to economize.  She always felt wicked after it, for the pretty",Little Women
514,"things were seldom necessaries, but then they cost so little, it wasn't",Little Women
514,"worth worrying about, so the trifles increased unconsciously, and in",Little Women
514,the shopping excursions she was no longer a passive looker-on.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"But the trifles cost more than one would imagine, and when she cast up",Little Women
514,her accounts at the end of the month the sum total rather scared her.,Little Women
514,"John was busy that month and left the bills to her, the next month he",Little Women
514,"was absent, but the third he had a grand quarterly settling up, and Meg",Little Women
514,"never forgot it.  A few days before she had done a dreadful thing, and",Little Women
514,"it weighed upon her conscience.  Sallie had been buying silks, and Meg",Little Women
514,"longed for a new one, just a handsome light one for parties, her black",Little Women
514,"silk was so common, and thin things for evening wear were only proper",Little Women
514,for girls.  Aunt March usually gave the sisters a present of,Little Women
514,twenty-five dollars apiece at New Year's.  That was only a month to,Little Women
514,"wait, and here was a lovely violet silk going at a bargain, and she had",Little Women
514,"the money, if she only dared to take it.  John always said what was his",Little Women
514,"was hers, but would he think it right to spend not only the prospective",Little Women
514,"five-and-twenty, but another five-and-twenty out of the household fund?",Little Women
514,"That was the question. Sallie had urged her to do it, had offered to",Little Women
514,"lend the money, and with the best intentions in life had tempted Meg",Little Women
514,"beyond her strength. In an evil moment the shopman held up the lovely,",Little Women
514,"shimmering folds, and said, ""A bargain, I assure, you, ma'am."" She",Little Women
514,"answered, ""I'll take it,"" and it was cut off and paid for, and Sallie",Little Women
514,"had exulted, and she had laughed as if it were a thing of no",Little Women
514,"consequence, and driven away, feeling as if she had stolen something,",Little Women
514,and the police were after her.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"When she got home, she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse by",Little Women
514,"spreading forth the lovely silk, but it looked less silvery now, didn't",Little Women
514,"become her, after all, and the words 'fifty dollars' seemed stamped",Little Women
514,"like a pattern down each breadth.  She put it away, but it haunted her,",Little Women
514,"not delightfully as a new dress should, but dreadfully like the ghost",Little Women
514,of a folly that was not easily laid.  When John got out his books that,Little Women
514,"night, Meg's heart sank, and for the first time in her married life,",Little Women
514,"she was afraid of her husband.  The kind, brown eyes looked as if they",Little Women
514,"could be stern, and though he was unusually merry, she fancied he had",Little Women
514,"found her out, but didn't mean to let her know it.  The house bills",Little Women
514,"were all paid, the books all in order. John had praised her, and was",Little Women
514,"undoing the old pocketbook which they called the 'bank', when Meg,",Little Women
514,"knowing that it was quite empty, stopped his hand, saying nervously...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You haven't seen my private expense book yet.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"John never asked to see it, but she always insisted on his doing so,",Little Women
514,and used to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things women,Little Women
514,"wanted, and made him guess what piping was, demand fiercely the meaning",Little Women
514,"of a hug-me-tight, or wonder how a little thing composed of three",Little Women
514,"rosebuds, a bit of velvet, and a pair of strings, could possibly be a",Little Women
514,"bonnet, and cost six dollars.  That night he looked as if he would like",Little Women
514,the fun of quizzing her figures and pretending to be horrified at her,Little Women
514,"extravagance, as he often did, being particularly proud of his prudent",Little Women
514,wife.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,The little book was brought slowly out and laid down before him. Meg,Little Women
514,got behind his chair under pretense of smoothing the wrinkles out of,Little Women
514,"his tired forehead, and standing there, she said, with her panic",Little Women
514,increasing with every word...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""John, dear, I'm ashamed to show you my book, for I've really been",Little Women
514,"dreadfully extravagant lately.  I go about so much I must have things,",Little Women
514,"you know, and Sallie advised my getting it, so I did, and my New Year's",Little Women
514,"money will partly pay for it, but I was sorry after I had done it, for",Little Women
514,"I knew you'd think it wrong in me.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"John laughed, and drew her round beside him, saying goodhumoredly,",Little Women
514,"""Don't go and hide.  I won't beat you if you have got a pair of killing",Little Women
514,"boots.  I'm rather proud of my wife's feet, and don't mind if she does",Little Women
514,"pay eight or nine dollars for her boots, if they are good ones.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"That had been one of her last 'trifles', and John's eye had fallen on",Little Women
514,"it as he spoke.  ""Oh, what will he say when he comes to that awful",Little Women
514,"fifty dollars!"" thought Meg, with a shiver.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's worse than boots, it's a silk dress,"" she said, with the calmness",Little Women
514,"of desperation, for she wanted the worst over.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, dear, what is the 'dem'd total', as Mr. Mantalini says?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"That didn't sound like John, and she knew he was looking up at her with",Little Women
514,the straightforward look that she had always been ready to meet and,Little Women
514,answer with one as frank till now.  She turned the page and her head at,Little Women
514,"the same time, pointing to the sum which would have been bad enough",Little Women
514,"without the fifty, but which was appalling to her with that added.  For",Little Women
514,"a minute the room was very still, then John said slowly--but she could",Little Women
514,feel it cost him an effort to express no displeasure--. . .,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, I don't know that fifty is much for a dress, with all the",Little Women
514,"furbelows and notions you have to have to finish it off these days.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It isn't made or trimmed,"" sighed Meg, faintly, for a sudden",Little Women
514,recollection of the cost still to be incurred quite overwhelmed her.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Twenty-five yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one small woman,",Little Women
514,but I've no doubt my wife will look as fine as Ned Moffat's when she,Little Women
514,"gets it on,"" said John dryly.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I know you are angry, John, but I can't help it.  I don't mean to",Little Women
514,"waste your money, and I didn't think those little things would count up",Little Women
514,"so.  I can't resist them when I see Sallie buying all she wants, and",Little Women
514,"pitying me because I don't.  I try to be contented, but it is hard, and",Little Women
514,"I'm tired of being poor.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear them, but",Little Women
514,"he did, and they wounded him deeply, for he had denied himself many",Little Women
514,pleasures for Meg's sake.  She could have bitten her tongue out the,Little Women
514,"minute she had said it, for John pushed the books away and got up,",Little Women
514,"saying with a little quiver in his voice, ""I was afraid of this.  I do",Little Women
514,"my best, Meg.""  If he had scolded her, or even shaken her, it would not",Little Women
514,have broken her heart like those few words.  She ran to him and held,Little Women
514,"him close, crying, with repentant tears, ""Oh, John, my dear, kind,",Little Women
514,"hard-working boy.  I didn't mean it!  It was so wicked, so untrue and",Little Women
514,"ungrateful, how could I say it! Oh, how could I say it!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He was very kind, forgave her readily, and did not utter one reproach,",Little Women
514,but Meg knew that she had done and said a thing which would not be,Little Women
514,"forgotten soon, although he might never allude to it again.  She had",Little Women
514,"promised to love him for better or worse, and then she, his wife, had",Little Women
514,"reproached him with his poverty, after spending his earnings",Little Women
514,"recklessly.  It was dreadful, and the worst of it was John went on so",Little Women
514,"quietly afterward, just as if nothing had happened, except that he",Little Women
514,"stayed in town later, and worked at night when she had gone to cry",Little Women
514,"herself to sleep.  A week of remorse nearly made Meg sick, and the",Little Women
514,discovery that John had countermanded the order for his new greatcoat,Little Women
514,reduced her to a state of despair which was pathetic to behold.  He had,Little Women
514,"simply said, in answer to her surprised inquiries as to the change, ""I",Little Women
514,"can't afford it, my dear.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg said no more, but a few minutes after he found her in the hall with",Little Women
514,"her face buried in the old greatcoat, crying as if her heart would",Little Women
514,break.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"They had a long talk that night, and Meg learned to love her husband",Little Women
514,"better for his poverty, because it seemed to have made a man of him,",Little Women
514,"given him the strength and courage to fight his own way, and taught him",Little Women
514,a tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural longings,Little Women
514,and failures of those he loved.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Next day she put her pride in her pocket, went to Sallie, told the",Little Women
514,"truth, and asked her to buy the silk as a favor.  The good-natured Mrs.",Little Women
514,"Moffat willingly did so, and had the delicacy not to make her a present",Little Women
514,"of it immediately afterward.  Then Meg ordered home the greatcoat, and",Little Women
514,"when John arrived, she put it on, and asked him how he liked her new",Little Women
514,"silk gown.  One can imagine what answer he made, how he received his",Little Women
514,"present, and what a blissful state of things ensued.  John came home",Little Women
514,"early, Meg gadded no more, and that greatcoat was put on in the morning",Little Women
514,"by a very happy husband, and taken off at night by a most devoted",Little Women
514,"little wife.  So the year rolled round, and at midsummer there came to",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Shut your eyes and hold out your arms,"" she said invitingly.",Little Women

514,"strings in an irreproachable bow, wrestled viciously with pins as she",Little Women
514,"put on her collar, wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out",Little Women
514,"the handkerchief, whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the",Little Women
514,"present mission was to her feelings, and when she had squeezed her",Little Women
514,"hands into tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel, as the last",Little Women
514,"touch of elegance, she turned to Amy with an imbecile expression of",Little Women

514,"can do well, Jo, that is, wear a shawl.  I can't, but it's very nice to",Little Women

514,"my child.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Amy looked relieved, but naughty Jo took her at her word, for during",Little Women
514,"the first call she sat with every limb gracefully composed, every fold",Little Women
514,"correctly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a snowbank, and as",Little Women
514,silent as the sphinx.  In vain Mrs. Chester alluded to her 'charming,Little Women
514,"novel', and the Misses Chester introduced parties, picnics, the opera,",Little Women
514,"and the fashions.  Each and all were answered by a smile, a bow, and a",Little Women
514,"demure ""Yes"" or ""No"" with the chill on.  In vain Amy telegraphed the",Little Women
514,"word 'talk', tried to draw her out, and administered covert pokes with",Little Women
514,"her foot.  Jo sat as if blandly unconscious of it all, with deportment",Little Women
514,"like Maud's face, 'icily regular, splendidly null'.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What a haughty, uninteresting creature that oldest Miss March is!"" was",Little Women
514,"the unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies, as the door",Little Women
514,"closed upon their guests.  Jo laughed noiselessly all through the hall,",Little Women
514,"but Amy looked disgusted at the failure of her instructions, and very",Little Women
514,naturally laid the blame upon Jo.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How could you mistake me so?  I merely meant you to be properly",Little Women
514,"dignified and composed, and you made yourself a perfect stock and",Little Women

514,and be interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense comes,Little Women
514,"up.  They move in the best society, are valuable persons for us to",Little Women

514,"imitate what is called 'a charming girl'.  I can do it, for I have May",Little Women
514,"Chester as a model, and I'll improve upon her.  See if the Lambs don't",Little Women
514,"say, 'What a lively, nice creature that Jo March is!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Amy felt anxious, as well she might, for when Jo turned freakish there",Little Women
514,was no knowing where she would stop.  Amy's face was a study when she,Little Women
514,"saw her sister skim into the next drawing room, kiss all the young",Little Women
514,"ladies with effusion, beam graciously upon the young gentlemen, and",Little Women
514,join in the chat with a spirit which amazed the beholder. Amy was taken,Little Women
514,"possession of by Mrs. Lamb, with whom she was a favorite, and forced to",Little Women
514,"hear a long account of Lucretia's last attack, while three delightful",Little Women
514,"young gentlemen hovered near, waiting for a pause when they might rush",Little Women
514,"in and rescue her.  So situated, she was powerless to check Jo, who",Little Women
514,"seemed possessed by a spirit of mischief, and talked away as volubly as",Little Women
514,"the lady.  A knot of heads gathered about her, and Amy strained her",Little Women
514,"ears to hear what was going on, for broken sentences filled her with",Little Women
514,"curiosity, and frequent peals of laughter made her wild to share the",Little Women
514,fun.  One may imagine her suffering on overhearing fragments of this,Little Women
514,sort of conversation.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""She rides splendidly.  Who taught her?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No one.  She used to practice mounting, holding the reins, and sitting",Little Women
514,"straight on an old saddle in a tree.  Now she rides anything, for she",Little Women
514,"doesn't know what fear is, and the stableman lets her have horses cheap",Little Women
514,because she trains them to carry ladies so well.  She has such a,Little Women
514,"passion for it, I often tell her if everything else fails, she can be a",Little Women
514,"horsebreaker, and get her living so.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"At this awful speech Amy contained herself with difficulty, for the",Little Women
514,"impression was being given that she was rather a fast young lady, which",Little Women
514,was her especial aversion.  But what could she do?  For the old lady,Little Women
514,"was in the middle of her story, and long before it was done, Jo was off",Little Women
514,"again, making more droll revelations and committing still more fearful",Little Women
514,blunders.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, Amy was in despair that day, for all the good beasts were gone,",Little Women
514,"and of three left, one was lame, one blind, and the other so balky that",Little Women

514,"a pleasure party, wasn't it?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Which did she choose?"" asked one of the laughing gentlemen, who",Little Women
514,enjoyed the subject.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""None of them.  She heard of a young horse at the farm house over the",Little Women
514,"river, and though a lady had never ridden him, she resolved to try,",Little Women
514,because he was handsome and spirited.  Her struggles were really,Little Women
514,"pathetic.  There was no one to bring the horse to the saddle, so she",Little Women
514,"took the saddle to the horse.  My dear creature, she actually rowed it",Little Women
514,"over the river, put it on her head, and marched up to the barn to the",Little Women
514,"utter amazement of the old man!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Did she ride the horse?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Of course she did, and had a capital time.  I expected to see her",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, I call that plucky!"" and young Mr. Lamb turned an approving",Little Women
514,"glance upon Amy, wondering what his mother could be saying to make the",Little Women
514,girl look so red and uncomfortable.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after, when a",Little Women
514,sudden turn in the conversation introduced the subject of dress.  One,Little Women
514,of the young ladies asked Jo where she got the pretty drab hat she wore,Little Women
514,"to the picnic and stupid Jo, instead of mentioning the place where it",Little Women
514,"was bought two years ago, must needs answer with unnecessary frankness,",Little Women
514,"""Oh, Amy painted it.  You can't buy those soft shades, so we paint ours",Little Women
514,"any color we like.  It's a great comfort to have an artistic sister.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Isn't that an original idea?"" cried Miss Lamb, who found Jo great fun.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That's nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances. There's",Little Women
514,"nothing the child can't do.  Why, she wanted a pair of blue boots for",Little Women
514,"Sallie's party, so she just painted her soiled white ones the loveliest",Little Women
514,"shade of sky blue you ever saw, and they looked exactly like satin,""",Little Women
514,"added Jo, with an air of pride in her sister's accomplishments that",Little Women
514,exasperated Amy till she felt that it would be a relief to throw her,Little Women
514,cardcase at her.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""We read a story of yours the other day, and enjoyed it very much,""",Little Women
514,"observed the elder Miss Lamb, wishing to compliment the literary lady,",Little Women
514,"who did not look the character just then, it must be confessed.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Any mention of her 'works' always had a bad effect upon Jo, who either",Little Women
514,"grew rigid and looked offended, or changed the subject with a brusque",Little Women
514,"remark, as now.  ""Sorry you could find nothing better to read.  I write",Little Women
514,"that rubbish because it sells, and ordinary people like it.  Are you",Little Women
514,"going to New York this winter?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As Miss Lamb had 'enjoyed' the story, this speech was not exactly",Little Women
514,"grateful or complimentary.  The minute it was made Jo saw her mistake,",Little Women
514,"but fearing to make the matter worse, suddenly remembered that it was",Little Women
514,"for her to make the first move toward departure, and did so with an",Little Women
514,abruptness that left three people with half-finished sentences in their,Little Women
514,mouths.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Amy, we must go.  Good-by, dear, do come and see us.  We are pining",Little Women

514,"come, I don't think I shall have the heart to send you away.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Jo said this with such a droll imitation of May Chester's gushing style,Little Women
514,"that Amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible, feeling a strong",Little Women
514,desire to laugh and cry at the same time.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Didn't I do well?"" asked Jo, with a satisfied air as they walked away.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Nothing could have been worse,"" was Amy's crushing reply. ""What",Little Women
514,"possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats and",Little Women
514,"boots, and all the rest of it?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,"speak,"" said Amy despairingly.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Poor Jo looked abashed, and silently chafed the end of her nose with",Little Women
514,"the stiff handkerchief, as if performing a penance for her misdemeanors.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How shall I behave here?"" she asked, as they approached the third",Little Women
514,mansion.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Just as you please.  I wash my hands of you,"" was Amy's short answer.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Then I'll enjoy myself.  The boys are at home, and we'll have a",Little Women
514,"comfortable time.  Goodness knows I need a little change, for elegance",Little Women
514,"has a bad effect upon my constitution,"" returned Jo gruffly, being",Little Women
514,disturbed by her failure to suit.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,An enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children,Little Women
514,"speedily soothed her ruffled feelings, and leaving Amy to entertain the",Little Women
514,"hostess and Mr. Tudor, who happened to be calling likewise, Jo devoted",Little Women
514,herself to the young folks and found the change refreshing.  She,Little Women
514,"listened to college stories with deep interest, caressed pointers and",Little Women
514,"poodles without a murmur, agreed heartily that ""Tom Brown was a brick,""",Little Women
514,"regardless of the improper form of praise, and when one lad proposed a",Little Women
514,"visit to his turtle tank, she went with an alacrity which caused Mamma",Little Women
514,"to smile upon her, as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left",Little Women
514,"in a ruinous condition by filial hugs, bearlike but affectionate, and",Little Women
514,dearer to her than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an,Little Women
514,inspired Frenchwoman.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Leaving her sister to her own devices, Amy proceeded to enjoy herself",Little Women
514,to her heart's content.  Mr. Tudor's uncle had married an English lady,Little Women
514,"who was third cousin to a living lord, and Amy regarded the whole",Little Women
514,"family with great respect, for in spite of her American birth and",Little Women
514,"breeding, she possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best",Little Women
514,of us--that unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which,Little Women
514,set the most democratic nation under the sun in ferment at the coming,Little Women
514,"of a royal yellow-haired laddie, some years ago, and which still has",Little Women
514,"something to do with the love the young country bears the old, like",Little Women
514,"that of a big son for an imperious little mother, who held him while",Little Women
514,"she could, and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled.",Little Women
514,But even the satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the,Little Women
514,"British nobility did not render Amy forgetful of time, and when the",Little Women
514,"proper number of minutes had passed, she reluctantly tore herself from",Little Women
514,"this aristocratic society, and looked about for Jo, fervently hoping",Little Women
514,that her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which,Little Women
514,should bring disgrace upon the name of March.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It might have been worse, but Amy considered it bad.  For Jo sat on the",Little Women
514,"grass, with an encampment of boys about her, and a dirty-footed dog",Little Women
514,"reposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress, as she related",Little Women
514,one of Laurie's pranks to her admiring audience.  One small child was,Little Women
514,"poking turtles with Amy's cherished parasol, a second was eating",Little Women
514,"gingerbread over Jo's best bonnet, and a third playing ball with her",Little Women
514,"gloves, but all were enjoying themselves, and when Jo collected her",Little Women
514,"damaged property to go, her escort accompanied her, begging her to come",Little Women
514,"again, ""It was such fun to hear about Laurie's larks.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Capital boys, aren't they?  I feel quite young and brisk again after",Little Women
514,"that."" said Jo, strolling along with her hands behind her, partly from",Little Women
514,"habit, partly to conceal the bespattered parasol.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Why do you always avoid Mr. Tudor?"" asked Amy, wisely refraining from",Little Women
514,any comment upon Jo's dilapidated appearance.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't like him, he puts on airs, snubs his sisters, worries his",Little Women
514,"father, and doesn't speak respectfully of his mother.  Laurie says he",Little Women

514,"him alone.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You might treat him civilly, at least.  You gave him a cool nod, and",Little Women

514,"and the bow, it would have been right,"" said Amy reprovingly.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, it wouldn't,"" returned Jo, ""I neither like, respect, nor admire",Little Women
514,"Tudor, though his grandfather's uncle's nephew's niece was a third",Little Women
514,cousin to a lord.  Tommy is poor and bashful and good and very clever.,Little Women
514,"I think well of him, and like to show that I do, for he is a gentleman",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""It's no use trying to argue with you,"" began Amy.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not the least, my dear,"" interrupted Jo, ""so let us look amiable, and",Little Women

514,"grateful.""",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""What a good girl you are, Amy!"" said Jo, with a repentant glance from",Little Women

514,"spotless still.  ""I wish it was as easy for me to do little things to",Little Women
514,"please people as it is for you.  I think of them, but it takes too much",Little Women

514,"because there is more of you.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,"""I'll try not to, but I'm always possessed to burst out with some",Little Women

514,"They found Aunt Carrol with the old lady, both absorbed in some very",Little Women
514,"interesting subject, but they dropped it as the girls came in, with a",Little Women
514,conscious look which betrayed that they had been talking about their,Little Women
514,"nieces.  Jo was not in a good humor, and the perverse fit returned, but",Little Women
514,"Amy, who had virtuously done her duty, kept her temper and pleased",Little Women
514,"everybody, was in a most angelic frame of mind.  This amiable spirit",Little Women
514,"was felt at once, and both aunts 'my deared' her affectionately,",Little Women
514,"looking what they afterward said emphatically, ""That child improves",Little Women
514,"every day.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Are you going to help about the fair, dear?"" asked Mrs. Carrol, as Amy",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm not,"" put in Jo decidedly.  ""I hate to be patronized, and the",Little Women

514,"work.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Quite right and proper.  I like your grateful spirit, my dear. It's a",Little Women
514,"pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts.  Some do not, and",Little Women
514,"that is trying,"" observed Aunt March, looking over her spectacles at",Little Women
514,"Jo, who sat apart, rocking herself, with a somewhat morose expression.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,If Jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the balance,Little Women
514,"for one of them, she would have turned dove-like in a minute, but",Little Women
514,"unfortunately, we don't have windows in our breasts, and cannot see",Little Women
514,what goes on in the minds of our friends.  Better for us that we cannot,Little Women
514,"as a general thing, but now and then it would be such a comfort, such a",Little Women
514,"saving of time and temper.  By her next speech, Jo deprived herself of",Little Women
514,"several years of pleasure, and received a timely lesson in the art of",Little Women
514,holding her tongue.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I don't like favors, they oppress and make me feel like a slave.  I'd",Little Women
514,"rather do everything for myself, and be perfectly independent.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Ahem!"" coughed Aunt Carrol softly, with a look at Aunt March.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I told you so,"" said Aunt March, with a decided nod to Aunt Carrol.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Mercifully unconscious of what she had done, Jo sat with her nose in",Little Women
514,"the air, and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting.",Little Women

514,"""Pretty well, thanks to Aunt March, who lets Esther talk to me as often",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't know a word.  I'm very stupid about studying anything, can't",Little Women

514,brusque reply.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Another look passed between the ladies, and Aunt March said to Amy,",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Not at all, thank you, ma'am.  I'm very well, and mean to do great",Little Women

514,feeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a bad effect upon,Little Women
514,"her constitution.  She shook hands in a gentlemanly manner, but Amy",Little Women
514,"kissed both the aunts, and the girls departed, leaving behind them the",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,CONSEQUENCES,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Mrs. Chester's fair was so very elegant and select that it was,Little Women
514,considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be,Little Women
514,"invited to take a table, and everyone was much interested in the",Little Women
514,"matter.  Amy was asked, but Jo was not, which was fortunate for all",Little Women
514,"parties, as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her",Little Women
514,"life, and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on",Little Women
514,"easily.  The 'haughty, uninteresting creature' was let severely alone,",Little Women
514,but Amy's talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the,Little Women
514,"art table, and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate",Little Women
514,and valuable contributions to it.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened, then",Little Women
514,there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost,Little Women
514,"impossible to avoid, when some five-and-twenty women, old and young,",Little Women
514,"with all their private piques and prejudices, try to work together.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,May Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter was a greater,Little Women
514,"favorite than herself, and just at this time several trifling",Little Women
514,circumstances occurred to increase the feeling.  Amy's dainty,Little Women
514,pen-and-ink work entirely eclipsed May's painted vases--that was one,Little Women
514,thorn.  Then the all conquering Tudor had danced four times with Amy at,Little Women
514,a late party and only once with May--that was thorn number two.  But,Little Women
514,"the chief grievance that rankled in her soul, and gave an excuse for",Little Women
514,"her unfriendly conduct, was a rumor which some obliging gossip had",Little Women
514,"whispered to her, that the March girls had made fun of her at the",Little Women
514,"Lambs'. All the blame of this should have fallen upon Jo, for her",Little Women
514,"naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection, and the",Little Women
514,frolicsome Lambs had permitted the joke to escape.  No hint of this had,Little Women
514,"reached the culprits, however, and Amy's dismay can be imagined, when,",Little Women
514,"the very evening before the fair, as she was putting the last touches",Little Women
514,"to her pretty table, Mrs. Chester, who, of course, resented the",Little Women
514,"supposed ridicule of her daughter, said, in a bland tone, but with a",Little Women
514,cold look...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young ladies about",Little Women
514,my giving this table to anyone but my girls.  As this is the most,Little Women
514,"prominent, and some say the most attractive table of all, and they are",Little Women
514,"the chief getters-up of the fair, it is thought best for them to take",Little Women
514,"this place.  I'm sorry, but I know you are too sincerely interested in",Little Women
514,"the cause to mind a little personal disappointment, and you shall have",Little Women
514,"another table if you like.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Mrs. Chester fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver this,Little Women
514,"little speech, but when the time came, she found it rather difficult to",Little Women
514,"utter it naturally, with Amy's unsuspicious eyes looking straight at",Little Women
514,her full of surprise and trouble.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Amy felt that there was something behind this, but could not guess",Little Women
514,"what, and said quietly, feeling hurt, and showing that she did,",Little Women
514,"""Perhaps you had rather I took no table at all?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Now, my dear, don't have any ill feeling, I beg.  It's merely a matter",Little Women
514,"of expediency, you see, my girls will naturally take the lead, and this",Little Women
514,table is considered their proper place.  I think it very appropriate to,Little Women
514,"you, and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty, but",Little Women
514,"we must give up our private wishes, of course, and I will see that you",Little Women
514,have a good place elsewhere. Wouldn't you like the flower table? The,Little Women
514,"little girls undertook it, but they are discouraged.  You could make a",Little Women
514,"charming thing of it, and the flower table is always attractive you",Little Women
514,"know.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Especially to gentlemen,"" added May, with a look which enlightened Amy",Little Women
514,"as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor.  She colored angrily,",Little Women
514,"but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm, and answered with",Little Women
514,unexpected amiability...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It shall be as you please, Mrs. Chester.  I'll give up my place here",Little Women
514,"at once, and attend to the flowers, if you like.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You can put your own things on your own table, if you prefer,"" began",Little Women
514,"May, feeling a little conscience-stricken, as she looked at the pretty",Little Women
514,"racks, the painted shells, and quaint illuminations Amy had so",Little Women
514,"carefully made and so gracefully arranged.  She meant it kindly, but",Little Women
514,"Amy mistook her meaning, and said quickly...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, certainly, if they are in your way,"" and sweeping her",Little Women
514,"contributions into her apron, pell-mell, she walked off, feeling that",Little Women
514,herself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Now she's mad.  Oh, dear, I wish I hadn't asked you to speak,  Mama,""",Little Women
514,"said May, looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Girls' quarrels are soon over,"" returned her mother, feeling a trifle",Little Women
514,"ashamed of her own part in this one, as well she might.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The little girls hailed Amy and her treasures with delight, which",Little Women
514,"cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit, and she fell",Little Women
514,"to work, determined to succeed florally, if she could not artistically.",Little Women
514,"But everything seemed against her.  It was late, and she was tired.",Little Women
514,"Everyone was too busy with their own affairs to help her, and the",Little Women
514,"little girls were only hindrances, for the dears fussed and chattered",Little Women
514,"like so many magpies, making a great deal of confusion in their artless",Little Women
514,efforts to preserve the most perfect order.  The evergreen arch,Little Women
514,"wouldn't stay firm after she got it up, but wiggled and threatened to",Little Women
514,tumble down on her head when the hanging baskets were filled.  Her best,Little Women
514,"tile got a splash of water, which left a sepia tear on the Cupid's",Little Women
514,"cheek.  She bruised her hands with hammering, and got cold working in a",Little Women
514,"draft, which last affliction filled her with apprehensions for the",Little Women
514,morrow.  Any girl reader who has suffered like afflictions will,Little Women
514,sympathize with poor Amy and wish her well through her task.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,There was great indignation at home when she told her story that,Little Women
514,"evening.  Her mother said it was a shame, but told her she had done",Little Women
514,"right.  Beth declared she wouldn't go to the fair at all, and Jo",Little Women
514,demanded why she didn't take all her pretty things and leave those mean,Little Women
514,people to get on without her.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Because they are mean is no reason why I should be.  I hate such",Little Women
514,"things, and though I think I've a right to be hurt, I don't intend to",Little Women
514,show it.  They will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy,Little Women
514,"actions, won't they, Marmee?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That's the right spirit, my dear.  A kiss for a blow is always best,",Little Women
514,"though it's not very easy to give it sometimes,"" said her mother, with",Little Women
514,the air of one who had learned the difference between preaching and,Little Women
514,practicing.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"In spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate,",Little Women
514,"Amy adhered to her resolution all the next day, bent on conquering her",Little Women
514,"enemy by kindness.  She began well, thanks to a silent reminder that",Little Women
514,"came to her unexpectedly, but most opportunely. As she arranged her",Little Women
514,"table that morning, while the little girls were in the anteroom filling",Little Women
514,"the baskets, she took up her pet production, a little book, the antique",Little Women
514,"cover of which her father had found among his treasures, and in which",Little Women
514,on leaves of vellum she had beautifully illuminated different texts.,Little Women
514,As she turned the pages rich in dainty devices with very pardonable,Little Women
514,"pride, her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think.",Little Women
514,"Framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet, blue and gold, with little",Little Women
514,spirits of good will helping one another up and down among the thorns,Little Women
514,"and flowers, were the words, ""Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I ought, but I don't,"" thought Amy, as her eye went from the bright",Little Women
514,"page to May's discontented face behind the big vases, that could not",Little Women
514,hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled.  Amy stood a,Little Women
514,"minute, turning the leaves in her hand, reading on each some sweet",Little Women
514,rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit. Many wise,Little Women
514,and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in,Little Women
514,"street, school, office, or home.  Even a fair table may become a",Little Women
514,"pulpit, if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out",Little Women
514,of season.  Amy's conscience preached her a little sermon from that,Little Women
514,"text, then and there, and she did what many of us do not always do,",Little Women
514,"took the sermon to heart, and straightway put it in practice.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"A group of girls were standing about May's table, admiring the pretty",Little Women
514,"things, and talking over the change of saleswomen.  They dropped their",Little Women
514,"voices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her, hearing one side of the",Little Women
514,"story and judging accordingly.  It was not pleasant, but a better",Little Women
514,"spirit had come over her, and presently a chance offered for proving",Little Women
514,it.  She heard May say sorrowfully...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's too bad, for there is no time to make other things, and I don't",Little Women
514,want to fill up with odds and ends.  The table was just complete then.,Little Women
514,"Now it's spoiled.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I dare say she'd put them back if you asked her,"" suggested someone.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How could I after all the fuss?"" began May, but she did not finish,",Little Women
514,"for Amy's voice came across the hall, saying pleasantly...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You may have them, and welcome, without asking, if you want them.  I",Little Women
514,"was just thinking I'd offer to put them back, for they belong to your",Little Women
514,"table rather than mine.  Here they are, please take them, and forgive",Little Women
514,"me if I was hasty in carrying them away last night.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As she spoke, Amy returned her contribution, with a nod and a smile,",Little Women
514,"and hurried away again, feeling that it was easier to do a friendly",Little Women
514,thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Now, I call that lovely of her, don't you?"" cried one girl.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"May's answer was inaudible, but another young lady, whose temper was",Little Women
514,"evidently a little soured by making lemonade, added, with a",Little Women
514,"disagreeable laugh, ""Very lovely, for she knew she wouldn't sell them",Little Women
514,"at her own table.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Now, that was hard.  When we make little sacrifices we like to have",Little Women
514,"them appreciated, at least, and for a minute Amy was sorry she had done",Little Women
514,"it, feeling that virtue was not always its own reward. But it is, as",Little Women
514,"she presently discovered, for her spirits began to rise, and her table",Little Women
514,"to blossom under her skillful hands, the girls were very kind, and that",Little Women
514,one little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It was a very long day and a hard one for Amy, as she sat behind her",Little Women
514,"table, often quite alone, for the little girls deserted very soon.  Few",Little Women
514,"cared to buy flowers in summer, and her bouquets began to droop long",Little Women
514,before night.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,The art table was the most attractive in the room.  There was a crowd,Little Women
514,"about it all day long, and the tenders were constantly flying to and",Little Women
514,fro with important faces and rattling money boxes.  Amy often looked,Little Women
514,"wistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt at home and",Little Women
514,"happy, instead of in a corner with nothing to do.  It might seem no",Little Women
514,"hardship to some of us, but to a pretty, blithe young girl, it was not",Little Women
514,"only tedious, but very trying, and the thought of Laurie and his",Little Women
514,friends made it a real martyrdom.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale and quiet",Little Women
514,"that they knew the day had been a hard one, though she made no",Little Women
514,"complaint, and did not even tell what she had done.  Her mother gave",Little Women
514,"her an extra cordial cup of tea.  Beth helped her dress, and made a",Little Women
514,"charming little wreath for her hair, while Jo astonished her family by",Little Women
514,"getting herself up with unusual care, and hinting darkly that the",Little Women
514,tables were about to be turned.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't do anything rude, pray Jo; I won't have any fuss made, so let it",Little Women
514,"all pass and behave yourself,"" begged Amy, as she departed early,",Little Women
514,hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor little,Little Women
514,table.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to every one I",Little Women
514,"know, and to keep them in your corner as long as possible. Teddy and",Little Women
514,"his boys will lend a hand, and we'll have a good time yet."" returned",Little Women
514,"Jo, leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie.  Presently the familiar",Little Women
514,"tramp was heard in the dusk, and she ran out to meet him.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Is that my boy?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""As sure as this is my girl!"" and Laurie tucked her hand under his arm",Little Women
514,with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, Teddy, such doings!"" and Jo told Amy's wrongs with sisterly zeal.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by-and-by, and I'll be",Little Women
514,"hanged if I don't make them buy every flower she's got, and camp down",Little Women
514,"before her table afterward,"" said Laurie, espousing her cause with",Little Women
514,warmth.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""The flowers are not at all nice, Amy says, and the fresh ones may not",Little Women
514,"arrive in time.  I don't wish to be unjust or suspicious, but I",Little Women
514,shouldn't wonder if they never came at all.  When people do one mean,Little Women
514,"thing they are very likely to do another,"" observed Jo in a disgusted",Little Women
514,tone.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Didn't Hayes give you the best out of our gardens? I told him to.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I didn't know that, he forgot, I suppose, and, as your grandpa was",Little Women
514,"poorly, I didn't like to worry him by asking, though I did want some.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Now, Jo, how could you think there was any need of asking? They are",Little Women
514,"just as much yours as mine.  Don't we always go halves in everything?""",Little Women
514,"began Laurie, in the tone that always made Jo turn thorny.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Gracious, I hope not!  Half of some of your things wouldn't suit me at",Little Women
514,"all.  But we mustn't stand philandering here.  I've got to help Amy, so",Little Women
514,"you go and make yourself splendid, and if you'll be so very kind as to",Little Women
514,"let Hayes take a few nice flowers up to the Hall, I'll bless you",Little Women
514,"forever.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Couldn't you do it now?"" asked Laurie, so suggestively that Jo shut",Little Women
514,"the gate in his face with inhospitable haste, and called through the",Little Women
514,"bars, ""Go away, Teddy, I'm busy.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Thanks to the conspirators, the tables were turned that night, for",Little Women
514,"Hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers, with a lovely basket arranged",Little Women
514,in his best manner for a centerpiece.  Then the March family turned out,Little Women
514,"en masse, and Jo exerted herself to some purpose, for people not only",Little Women
514,"came, but stayed, laughing at her nonsense, admiring Amy's taste, and",Little Women
514,apparently enjoying themselves very much.  Laurie and his friends,Little Women
514,"gallantly threw themselves into the breach, bought up the bouquets,",Little Women
514,"encamped before the table, and made that corner the liveliest spot in",Little Women
514,"the room.  Amy was in her element now, and out of gratitude, if nothing",Little Women
514,"more, was as spritely and gracious as possible, coming to the",Little Women

514,the Chester change of base.  She reproached herself for her share of,Little Women
514,the ill feeling and resolved to exonerate Amy as soon as possible.  She,Little Women
514,"also discovered what Amy had done about the things in the morning, and",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"To May's great delight, Mr. Laurence not only bought the vases, but",Little Women

514,repinings at Amy's good fortune.  The young lady herself received the,Little Women
514,"news as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn sort of rapture,",Little Women
514,"and began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening, leaving",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""It isn't a mere pleasure trip to me, girls,"" she said impressively, as",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living,"" replied the",Little Women
514,"aspirant for fame, with philosophic composure. But she made a wry face",Little Women

514,"""Rather!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, in a year or two I'll send for you, and we'll dig in the Forum",Little Women

514,till she couldn't cry any more. Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the,Little Women

514,"the officers.  Don't laugh, Jo, gentlemen really are very necessary",Little Women
514,"aboard ship, to hold on to, or to wait upon one, and as they have",Little Women

514,"almost as exciting as riding a fast horse, when we went rushing on so",Little Women
514,"grandly.  I wish Beth could have come, it would have done her so much",Little Women
514,"good.  As for Jo, she would have gone up and sat on the maintop jib, or",Little Women
514,"whatever the high thing is called, made friends with the engineers, and",Little Women

514,"dogskin gloves, some ugly, thick shoes, and an umbrella, and got shaved",Little Women
514,"_a la_ mutton chop, the first thing. Then he flattered himself that he",Little Women
514,"looked like a true Briton, but the first time he had the mud cleaned",Little Women
514,"off his shoes, the little bootblack knew that an American stood in",Little Women
514,"them, and said, with a grin, ""There yer har, sir.  I've given 'em the",Little Women
514,"latest Yankee shine.""  It amused Uncle immensely.  Oh, I must tell you",Little Women
514,"what that absurd Lennox did!  He got his friend Ward, who came on with",Little Women

514,"that fun, girls? I like traveling.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,I never shall get to London if I don't hurry.  The trip was like riding,Little Women
514,"through a long picture gallery, full of lovely landscapes. The",Little Women
514,"farmhouses were my delight, with thatched roofs, ivy up to the eaves,",Little Women
514,"latticed windows, and stout women with rosy children at the doors.  The",Little Women
514,"very cattle looked more tranquil than ours, as they stood knee-deep in",Little Women
514,"clover, and the hens had a contented cluck, as if they never got",Little Women

514,"so green, sky so blue, grain so yellow, woods so dark, I was in a",Little Women

514,"in such a hurry I wasn't half ready. A white hat and blue feather, a",Little Women
514,"muslin dress to match, and the loveliest mantle you ever saw.  Shopping",Little Women
514,"in Regent Street is perfectly splendid.  Things seem so cheap, nice",Little Women

514,"fast that Flo was frightened, and told me to stop him, but he was up",Little Women
514,"outside behind somewhere, and I couldn't get at him.  He didn't hear me",Little Women
514,"call, nor see me flap my parasol in front, and there we were, quite",Little Women
514,"helpless, rattling away, and whirling around corners at a breakneck",Little Women
514,"pace. At last, in my despair, I saw a little door in the roof, and on",Little Women

514,"ask us to their house, but Uncle won't go, so we shall return the call,",Little Women
514,"and see them as we can.  They went to the theater with us, and we did",Little Women
514,"have such a good time, for Frank devoted himself to Flo, and Fred and I",Little Women
514,"talked over past, present, and future fun as if we had known each other",Little Women
514,"all our days.  Tell Beth Frank asked for her, and was sorry to hear of",Little Women
514,"her ill health.  Fred laughed when I spoke of Jo, and sent his",Little Women
514,'respectful compliments to the big hat'. Neither of them had forgotten,Little Women

514,"were, and what pleasant parties they made for us.  I enjoyed the trips",Little Women
514,"to Hampton Court and the Kensington Museum more than anything else, for",Little Women
514,"at Hampton I saw Raphael's cartoons, and at the Museum, rooms full of",Little Women
514,"pictures by Turner, Lawrence, Reynolds, Hogarth, and the other great",Little Women
514,"creatures.  The day in Richmond Park was charming, for we had a regular",Little Women
514,"English picnic, and I had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than I",Little Women
514,"could copy, also heard a nightingale, and saw larks go up.  We 'did'",Little Women
514,"London to our heart's content, thanks to Fred and Frank, and were sorry",Little Women
514,"to go away, for though English people are slow to take you in, when",Little Women
514,they once make up their minds to do it they cannot be outdone in,Little Women
514,"hospitality, I think.  The Vaughns hope to meet us in Rome next winter,",Little Women

514,"at first, but he was so cool about it she couldn't say a word.  And now",Little Women
514,"we get on nicely, and are very glad he came, for he speaks French like",Little Women
514,"a native, and I don't know what we should do without him.  Uncle",Little Women
514,"doesn't know ten words, and insists on talking English very loud, as if",Little Women
514,it would make people understand him.  Aunt's pronunciation is,Little Women
514,"old-fashioned, and Flo and I, though we flattered ourselves that we",Little Women
514,"knew a good deal, find we don't, and are very grateful to have Fred do",Little Women
514,"the '_parley vooing_', as Uncle calls it.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Such delightful times as we are having!  Sight-seeing from morning till,Little Women
514,"night, stopping for nice lunches in the gay _cafes_, and meeting with",Little Women
514,"all sorts of droll adventures.  Rainy days I spend in the Louvre,",Little Women
514,revelling in pictures.  Jo would turn up her naughty nose at some of,Little Women
514,"the finest, because she has no soul for art, but I have, and I'm",Little Women
514,cultivating eye and taste as fast as I can.  She would like the relics,Little Women
514,"of great people better, for I've seen her Napoleon's cocked hat and",Little Women
514,"gray coat, his baby's cradle and his old toothbrush, also Marie",Little Women
514,"Antoinette's little shoe, the ring of Saint Denis, Charlemagne's sword,",Little Women

514,"one sees a table, with images or pictures of the dead, and chairs for",Little Women

514,"go out.  Fred is very entertaining, and is altogether the most",Little Women
514,"agreeable young man I ever knew--except Laurie, whose manners are more",Little Women
514,"charming.  I wish Fred was dark, for I don't fancy light men, however,",Little Women

514,haven't words beautiful enough to describe it. At Coblentz we had a,Little Women
514,"lovely time, for some students from Bonn, with whom Fred got acquainted",Little Women
514,"on the boat, gave us a serenade. It was a moonlight night, and about",Little Women
514,one o'clock Flo and I were waked by the most delicious music under our,Little Women
514,"windows.  We flew up, and hid behind the curtains, but sly peeps showed",Little Women
514,us Fred and the students singing away down below.  It was the most,Little Women
514,"romantic thing I ever saw--the river, the bridge of boats, the great",Little Women
514,"fortress opposite, moonlight everywhere, and music fit to melt a heart",Little Women
514,of stone.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"When they were done we threw down some flowers, and saw them scramble",Little Women
514,"for them, kiss their hands to the invisible ladies, and go laughing",Little Women
514,"away, to smoke and drink beer, I suppose.  Next morning Fred showed me",Little Women
514,"one of the crumpled flowers in his vest pocket, and looked very",Little Women
514,"sentimental.  I laughed at him, and said I didn't throw it, but Flo,",Little Women
514,"which seemed to disgust him, for he tossed it out of the window, and",Little Women
514,turned sensible again.  I'm afraid I'm going to have trouble with that,Little Women
514,"boy, it begins to look like it.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The baths at Nassau were very gay, so was Baden-Baden, where Fred lost",Little Women
514,"some money, and I scolded him.  He needs someone to look after him when",Little Women
514,"Frank is not with him.  Kate said once she hoped he'd marry soon, and I",Little Women
514,quite agree with her that it would be well for him.  Frankfurt was,Little Women
514,"delightful.  I saw Goethe's house, Schiller's statue, and Dannecker's",Little Women
514,"famous 'Ariadne.'  It was very lovely, but I should have enjoyed it",Little Women
514,"more if I had known the story better.  I didn't like to ask, as",Little Women
514,everyone knew it or pretended they did.  I wish Jo would tell me all,Little Women
514,"about it.  I ought to have read more, for I find I don't know anything,",Little Women
514,and it mortifies me.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Now comes the serious part, for it happened here, and Fred has just",Little Women
514,gone.  He has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite fond of him.,Little Women
514,I never thought of anything but a traveling friendship till the,Little Women
514,serenade night.  Since then I've begun to feel that the moonlight,Little Women
514,"walks, balcony talks, and daily adventures were something more to him",Little Women
514,"than fun.  I haven't flirted, Mother, truly, but remembered what you",Little Women
514,"said to me, and have done my very best.  I can't help it if people like",Little Women
514,"me.  I don't try to make them, and it worries me if I don't care for",Little Women
514,"them, though Jo says I haven't got any heart.  Now I know Mother will",Little Women
514,"shake her head, and the girls say, ""Oh, the mercenary little wretch!"",",Little Women
514,"but I've made up my mind, and if Fred asks me, I shall accept him,",Little Women
514,"though I'm not madly in love.  I like him, and we get on comfortably",Little Women
514,"together.  He is handsome, young, clever enough, and very rich--ever so",Little Women
514,"much richer than the Laurences.  I don't think his family would object,",Little Women
514,"and I should be very happy, for they are all kind, well-bred, generous",Little Women
514,"people, and they like me.  Fred, as the eldest twin, will have the",Little Women
514,"estate, I suppose, and such a splendid one it is!  A city house in a",Little Women
514,"fashionable street, not so showy as our big houses, but twice as",Little Women
514,"comfortable and full of solid luxury, such as English people believe",Little Women
514,"in.  I like it, for it's genuine.  I've seen the plate, the family",Little Women
514,"jewels, the old servants, and pictures of the country place, with its",Little Women
514,"park, great house, lovely grounds, and fine horses.  Oh, it would be",Little Women
514,all I should ask!  And I'd rather have it than any title such as girls,Little Women
514,"snap up so readily, and find nothing behind.  I may be mercenary, but I",Little Women
514,"hate poverty, and don't mean to bear it a minute longer than I can",Little Women
514,"help.  One of us _must_ marry well.  Meg didn't, Jo won't, Beth can't",Little Women
514,"yet, so I shall, and make everything okay all round.  I wouldn't marry",Little Women
514,"a man I hated or despised.  You may be sure of that, and though Fred is",Little Women
514,"not my model hero, he does very well, and in time I should get fond",Little Women
514,"enough of him if he was very fond of me, and let me do just as I liked.",Little Women
514,"So I've been turning the matter over in my mind the last week, for it",Little Women
514,"was impossible to help seeing that Fred liked me.  He said nothing, but",Little Women
514,"little things showed it.  He never goes with Flo, always gets on my",Little Women
514,"side of the carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental when we",Little Women
514,"are alone, and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak to me.",Little Women
514,"Yesterday at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us and then",Little Women
514,"said something to his friend, a rakish-looking baron, about '_ein",Little Women
514,"wonderschones Blondchen'_, Fred looked as fierce as a lion, and cut his",Little Women
514,meat so savagely it nearly flew off his plate.  He isn't one of the,Little Women
514,"cool, stiff Englishmen, but is rather peppery, for he has Scotch blood",Little Women
514,"in him, as one might guess from his bonnie blue eyes.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Well, last evening we went up to the castle about sunset, at least all",Little Women
514,"of us but Fred, who was to meet us there after going to the Post",Little Women
514,"Restante for letters.  We had a charming time poking about the ruins,",Little Women
514,"the vaults where the monster tun is, and the beautiful gardens made by",Little Women
514,the elector long ago for his English wife.  I liked the great terrace,Little Women
514,"best, for the view was divine, so while the rest went to see the rooms",Little Women
514,"inside, I sat there trying to sketch the gray stone lion's head on the",Little Women
514,"wall, with scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it.  I felt as if I'd",Little Women
514,"got into a romance, sitting there, watching the Neckar rolling through",Little Women
514,"the valley, listening to the music of the Austrian band below, and",Little Women
514,"waiting for my lover, like a real storybook girl.  I had a feeling that",Little Women
514,something was going to happen and I was ready for it.  I didn't feel,Little Women
514,"blushy or quakey, but quite cool and only a little excited.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"By-and-by I heard Fred's voice, and then he came hurrying through the",Little Women
514,great arch to find me.  He looked so troubled that I forgot all about,Little Women
514,"myself, and asked what the matter was.  He said he'd just got a letter",Little Women
514,"begging him to come home, for Frank was very ill.  So he was going at",Little Women
514,once on the night train and only had time to say good-by.  I was very,Little Women
514,"sorry for him, and disappointed for myself, but only for a minute",Little Women
514,"because he said, as he shook hands, and said it in a way that I could",Little Women
514,"not mistake,  ""I shall soon come back, you won't forget me, Amy?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"I didn't promise, but I looked at him, and he seemed satisfied, and",Little Women
514,"there was no time for anything but messages and good-byes, for he was",Little Women
514,"off in an hour, and we all miss him very much. I know he wanted to",Little Women
514,"speak, but I think, from something he once hinted, that he had promised",Little Women
514,"his father not to do anything of the sort yet a while, for he is a rash",Little Women
514,"boy, and the old gentleman dreads a foreign daughter-in-law.  We shall",Little Women
514,"soon meet in Rome, and then, if I don't change my mind, I'll say ""Yes,",Little Women
514,"thank you,"" when he says ""Will you, please?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Of course this is all _very private_, but I wished you to know what was",Little Women
514,"going on.  Don't be anxious about me, remember I am your 'prudent Amy',",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"While apparently absorbed in her own affairs, Jo watched Beth, and",Little Women
514,"after many conflicting conjectures, finally settled upon one which",Little Women
514,seemed to explain the change in her.  A slight incident gave Jo the,Little Women
514,"clue to the mystery, she thought, and lively fancy, loving heart did",Little Women
514,"the rest.  She was affecting to write busily one Saturday afternoon,",Little Women
514,"when she and Beth were alone together.  Yet as she scribbled, she kept",Little Women
514,"her eye on her sister, who seemed unusually quiet.  Sitting at the",Little Women
514,"window, Beth's work often dropped into her lap, and she leaned her head",Little Women
514,"upon her hand, in a dejected attitude, while her eyes rested on the",Little Women
514,"dull, autumnal landscape.  Suddenly some one passed below, whistling",Little Women
514,"like an operatic blackbird, and a voice called out, ""All serene! Coming",Little Women
514,"in tonight.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Beth started, leaned forward, smiled and nodded, watched the passer-by",Little Women
514,"till his quick tramp died away, then said softly as if to herself, ""How",Little Women
514,"strong and well and happy that dear boy looks.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Hum!"" said Jo, still intent upon her sister's face, for the bright",Little Women
514,"color faded as quickly as it came, the smile vanished, and presently a",Little Women
514,"tear lay shining on the window ledge.  Beth whisked it off, and in her",Little Women
514,half-averted face read a tender sorrow that made her own eyes fill.,Little Women
514,"Fearing to betray herself, she slipped away, murmuring something about",Little Women
514,needing more paper.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Mercy on me, Beth loves Laurie!"" she said, sitting down in her own",Little Women
514,"room, pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed she had",Little Women
514,"just made.  ""I never dreamed of such a thing. What will Mother say?  I",Little Women
514,"wonder if her...""  there Jo stopped and turned scarlet with a sudden",Little Women
514,"thought.  ""If he shouldn't love back again, how dreadful it would be.",Little Women
514,"He must.  I'll make him!"" and she shook her head threateningly at the",Little Women
514,picture of the mischievous-looking boy laughing at her from the wall.,Little Women
514,"""Oh dear, we are growing up with a vengeance.  Here's Meg married and a",Little Women
514,"mamma, Amy flourishing away at Paris, and Beth in love.  I'm the only",Little Women
514,"one that has sense enough to keep out of mischief."" Jo thought intently",Little Women
514,"for a minute with her eyes fixed on the picture, then she smoothed out",Little Women
514,"her wrinkled forehead and said, with a decided nod at the face",Little Women
514,"opposite, ""No thank you, sir, you're very charming, but you've no more",Little Women
514,stability than a weathercock.  So you needn't write touching notes and,Little Women
514,"smile in that insinuating way, for it won't do a bit of good, and I",Little Women
514,"won't have it.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Then she sighed, and fell into a reverie from which she did not wake",Little Women
514,"till the early twilight sent her down to take new observations, which",Little Women
514,only confirmed her suspicion.  Though Laurie flirted with Amy and joked,Little Women
514,"with Jo, his manner to Beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle,",Little Women
514,"but so was everybody's. Therefore, no one thought of imagining that he",Little Women
514,"cared more for her than for the others.  Indeed, a general impression",Little Women
514,had prevailed in the family of late that 'our boy' was getting fonder,Little Women
514,"than ever of Jo, who, however, wouldn't hear a word upon the subject",Little Women
514,and scolded violently if anyone dared to suggest it. If they had known,Little Women
514,"the various tender passages which had been nipped in the bud, they",Little Women
514,"would have had the immense satisfaction of saying, ""I told you so.""",Little Women
514,"But Jo hated 'philandering', and wouldn't allow it, always having a",Little Women

514,"When Laurie first went to college, he fell in love about once a month,",Little Women
514,"but these small flames were as brief as ardent, did no damage, and much",Little Women
514,"amused Jo, who took great interest in the alternations of hope,",Little Women
514,"despair, and resignation, which were confided to her in their weekly",Little Women
514,conferences.  But there came a time when Laurie ceased to worship at,Little Women
514,"many shrines, hinted darkly at one all-absorbing passion, and indulged",Little Women
514,occasionally in Byronic fits of gloom.  Then he avoided the tender,Little Women
514,"subject altogether, wrote philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious,",Little Women
514,"and gave out that he was going to 'dig', intending to graduate in a",Little Women
514,blaze of glory.  This suited the young lady better than twilight,Little Women
514,"confidences, tender pressures of the hand, and eloquent glances of the",Little Women
514,"eye, for with Jo, brain developed earlier than heart, and she preferred",Little Women
514,"imaginary heroes to real ones, because when tired of them, the former",Little Women
514,"could be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for, and the latter",Little Women
514,were less manageable.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Things were in this state when the grand discovery was made, and Jo",Little Women
514,watched Laurie that night as she had never done before.  If she had not,Little Women
514,"got the new idea into her head, she would have seen nothing unusual in",Little Women
514,"the fact that Beth was very quiet, and Laurie very kind to her.  But",Little Women
514,"having given the rein to her lively fancy, it galloped away with her at",Little Women
514,"a great pace, and common sense, being rather weakened by a long course",Little Women
514,"of romance writing, did not come to the rescue.  As usual Beth lay on",Little Women
514,"the sofa and Laurie sat in a low chair close by, amusing her with all",Little Women
514,"sorts of gossip, for she depended on her weekly 'spin', and he never",Little Women
514,disappointed her.  But that evening Jo fancied that Beth's eyes rested,Little Women
514,"on the lively, dark face beside her with peculiar pleasure, and that",Little Women
514,she listened with intense interest to an account of some exciting,Little Women
514,"cricket match, though the phrases, 'caught off a tice', 'stumped off",Little Women
514,"his ground', and 'the leg hit for three', were as intelligible to her",Little Women
514,"as Sanskrit.  She also fancied, having set her heart upon seeing it,",Little Women
514,"that she saw a certain increase of gentleness in Laurie's manner, that",Little Women
514,"he dropped his voice now and then, laughed less than usual, was a",Little Women
514,"little absent-minded, and settled the afghan over Beth's feet with an",Little Women
514,assiduity that was really almost tender.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Who knows?  Stranger things have happened,"" thought Jo, as she fussed",Little Women
514,"about the room.  ""She will make quite an angel of him, and he will make",Little Women
514,"life delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear, if they only love",Little Women
514,"each other.  I don't see how he can help it, and I do believe he would",Little Women
514,"if the rest of us were out of the way.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As everyone was out of the way but herself, Jo began to feel that she",Little Women
514,ought to dispose of herself with all speed.  But where should she go?,Little Women
514,"And burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion, she",Little Women
514,sat down to settle that point.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Now, the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa--long, broad,",Little Women
514,"well-cushioned, and low, a trifle shabby, as well it might be, for the",Little Women
514,"girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies, fished over the back,",Little Women
514,"rode on the arms, and had menageries under it as children, and rested",Little Women
514,"tired heads, dreamed dreams, and listened to tender talk on it as young",Little Women
514,"women.  They all loved it, for it was a family refuge, and one corner",Little Women
514,had always been Jo's favorite lounging place.  Among the many pillows,Little Women
514,"that adorned the venerable couch was one, hard, round, covered with",Little Women
514,"prickly horsehair, and furnished with a knobby button at each end.",Little Women
514,"This repulsive pillow was her especial property, being used as a weapon",Little Women
514,"of defense, a barricade, or a stern preventive of too much slumber.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie knew this pillow well, and had cause to regard it with deep",Little Women
514,"aversion, having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former days when",Little Women
514,"romping was allowed, and now frequently debarred by it from the seat he",Little Women
514,most coveted next to Jo in the sofa corner.  If 'the sausage' as they,Little Women
514,"called it, stood on end, it was a sign that he might approach and",Little Women
514,"repose, but if it lay flat across the sofa, woe to man, woman, or child",Little Women
514,"who dared disturb it!  That evening Jo forgot to barricade her corner,",Little Women
514,"and had not been in her seat five minutes, before a massive form",Little Women
514,"appeared beside her, and with both arms spread over the sofa back, both",Little Women
514,"long legs stretched out before him, Laurie exclaimed, with a sigh of",Little Women
514,satisfaction...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Now, this is filling at the price.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No slang,"" snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow.  But it was too late,",Little Women
514,"there was no room for it, and coasting onto the floor, it disappeared",Little Women
514,in a most mysterious manner.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Come, Jo, don't be thorny.  After studying himself to a skeleton all",Little Women
514,"the week, a fellow deserves petting and ought to get it.""",Little Women

514,"""Beth will pet you.  I'm busy.""",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom heard,",Little Women
514,"but Jo quenched 'her boy' by turning on him with a stern query, ""How",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Not one, upon my word.  She's engaged.  Now then.""",Little Women

514,"all parties understand that it's only play.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, it does look pleasant, but I can't learn how it's done. I've",Little Women

514,"""Take lessons of Amy, she has a regular talent for it.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, she does it very prettily, and never seems to go too far.  I",Little Women
514,"suppose it's natural to some people to please without trying, and",Little Women
514,"others to always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong place.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm glad you can't flirt.  It's really refreshing to see a sensible,",Little Women
514,"straightforward girl, who can be jolly and kind without making a fool",Little Women
514,"of herself.  Between ourselves, Jo, some of the girls I know really do",Little Women
514,"go on at such a rate I'm ashamed of them. They don't mean any harm, I'm",Little Women
514,"sure, but if they knew how we fellows talked about them afterward,",Little Women
514,"they'd mend their ways, I fancy.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""They do the same, and as their tongues are the sharpest, you fellows",Little Women
514,"get the worst of it, for you are as silly as they, every bit.  If you",Little Women

514,"keep it up, and then you blame them.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Much you know about it, ma'am,"" said Laurie in a superior tone. ""We",Little Women

514,"The pretty, modest girls are never talked about, except respectfully,",Little Women
514,among gentleman. Bless your innocent soul!  If you could be in my place,Little Women
514,for a month you'd see things that would astonish you a trifle. Upon my,Little Women
514,"word, when I see one of those harum-scarum girls, I always want to say",Little Women
514,with our friend Cock Robin...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"    ""Out upon you, fie upon you,",Little Women
514,"     Bold-faced jig!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,It was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict between,Little Women
514,"Laurie's chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind, and his very",Little Women
514,natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable society,Little Women
514,showed him many samples.  Jo knew that 'young Laurence' was regarded as,Little Women
514,"a most eligible parti by worldly mamas, was much smiled upon by their",Little Women
514,"daughters, and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb",Little Women
514,"of him, so she watched him rather jealously, fearing he would be",Little Women
514,"spoiled, and rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still",Little Women
514,"believed in modest girls.  Returning suddenly to her admonitory tone,",Little Women
514,"she said, dropping her voice, ""If you must have a 'vent', Teddy, go and",Little Women
514,"devote yourself to one of the 'pretty, modest girls' whom you do",Little Women
514,"respect, and not waste your time with the silly ones.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You really advise it?"" and Laurie looked at her with an odd mixture of",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, I do, but you'd better wait till you are through college, on the",Little Women
514,"whole, and be fitting yourself for the place meantime.  You're not half",Little Women
514,"good enough for--well, whoever the modest girl may be."" and Jo looked a",Little Women
514,"little queer likewise, for a name had almost escaped her.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That I'm not!"" acquiesced Laurie, with an expression of humility quite",Little Women
514,"new to him, as he dropped his eyes and absently wound Jo's apron tassel",Little Women
514,round his finger.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Mercy on us, this will never do,"" thought Jo, adding aloud, ""Go and",Little Women

514,,Little Women

514,"""Where is it?  Shall I call Mother?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, no, don't call her, don't tell her.  I shall be better soon.  Lie",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Jo obeyed, but as her hand went softly to and fro across Beth's hot",Little Women

514,"speak.  But young as she was, Jo had learned that hearts, like flowers,",Little Women
514,"cannot be rudely handled, but must open naturally, so though she",Little Women
514,"believed she knew the cause of Beth's new pain, she only said, in her",Little Women
514,"tenderest tone, ""Does anything trouble you, deary?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,"sunny window, so I can sit here and write whenever I like.  A fine view",Little Women
514,"and a church tower opposite atone for the many stairs, and I took a",Little Women

514,"come along behind her, take the heavy hod of coal out of her hand,",Little Women
514,"carry it all the way up, put it down at a door near by, and walk away,",Little Women

514,"doing things of that sort.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Mrs. K.  told me he was from Berlin, very learned and good, but poor as",Little Women

514,"interested me, and I was glad to hear that Mrs. K.  lends him her",Little Women

514,"Had a lively time in my seminary this morning, for the children acted",Little Women

514,"round.  Some good angel inspired me to try gymnastics, and I kept it up",Little Women
514,"till they were glad to sit down and keep still.  After luncheon, the",Little Women
514,"girl took them out for a walk, and I went to my needlework like little",Little Women
514,Mabel 'with a willing mind'.  I was thanking my stars that I'd learned,Little Women
514,"to make nice buttonholes, when the parlor door opened and shut, and",Little Women
514,"someone began to hum, Kennst Du Das Land, like a big bumblebee. It was",Little Women
514,"dreadfully improper, I know, but I couldn't resist the temptation, and",Little Women
514,"lifting one end of the curtain before the glass door, I peeped in.",Little Women
514,"Professor Bhaer was there, and while he arranged his books, I took a",Little Women
514,"good look at him.  A regular German--rather stout, with brown hair",Little Women
514,"tumbled all over his head, a bushy beard, good nose, the kindest eyes I",Little Women
514,"ever saw, and a splendid big voice that does one's ears good, after our",Little Women
514,"sharp or slipshod American gabble.  His clothes were rusty, his hands",Little Women
514,"were large, and he hadn't a really handsome feature in his face, except",Little Women
514,"his beautiful teeth, yet I liked him, for he had a fine head, his linen",Little Women
514,"was very nice, and he looked like a gentleman, though two buttons were",Little Women
514,off his coat and there was a patch on one shoe.  He looked sober in,Little Women
514,"spite of his humming, till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth",Little Women
514,"bulbs toward the sun, and stroke the cat, who received him like an old",Little Women
514,"friend.  Then he smiled, and when a tap came at the door, called out in",Little Women
514,"a loud, brisk tone, ""Herein!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,"""Now me mus tuddy my lessin,"" went on the funny little thing.  So he",Little Women
514,"put her up at the table, opened the great dictionary she had brought,",Little Women
514,"and gave her a paper and pencil, and she scribbled away, turning a leaf",Little Women
514,"now and then, and passing her little fat finger down the page, as if",Little Women
514,"finding a word, so soberly that I nearly betrayed myself by a laugh,",Little Women
514,while Mr. Bhaer stood stroking her pretty hair with a fatherly look,Little Women

514,Another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me back to my,Little Women

514,"say emphatically, ""No, no, it is not so, you haf not attend to what I",Little Women
514,"say,"" and once there was a loud rap, as if he struck the table with his",Little Women

514,"this day.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Poor man, I pitied him, and when the girls were gone, took just one",Little Women

514,"clock struck two, when he jumped up, put his books in his pocket, as if",Little Women
514,"ready for another lesson, and taking little Tina who had fallen asleep",Little Women
514,"on the sofa in his arms, he carried her quietly away.  I fancy he has a",Little Women
514,hard life of it.  Mrs. Kirke asked me if I wouldn't go down to the five,Little Women
514,"o'clock dinner, and feeling a little bit homesick, I thought I would,",Little Women
514,just to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me.  So I,Little Women
514,"made myself respectable and tried to slip in behind Mrs. Kirke, but as",Little Women
514,"she is short and I'm tall, my efforts at concealment were rather a",Little Women
514,"failure.  She gave me a seat by her, and after my face cooled off, I",Little Women
514,"plucked up courage and looked about me.  The long table was full, and",Little Women
514,"every one intent on getting their dinner, the gentlemen especially, who",Little Women
514,"seemed to be eating on time, for they bolted in every sense of the",Little Women
514,"word, vanishing as soon as they were done.  There was the usual",Little Women
514,"assortment of young men absorbed in themselves, young couples absorbed",Little Women
514,"in each other, married ladies in their babies, and old gentlemen in",Little Women
514,politics.  I don't think I shall care to have much to do with any of,Little Women
514,"them, except one sweetfaced maiden lady, who looks as if she had",Little Women
514,something in her.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Cast away at the very bottom of the table was the Professor, shouting",Little Women
514,"answers to the questions of a very inquisitive, deaf old gentleman on",Little Women
514,"one side, and talking philosophy with a Frenchman on the other.  If Amy",Little Women
514,"had been here, she'd have turned her back on him forever because, sad",Little Women
514,"to relate, he had a great appetite, and shoveled in his dinner in a",Little Women
514,"manner which would have horrified 'her ladyship'.  I didn't mind, for I",Little Women
514,"like 'to see folks eat with a relish', as Hannah says, and the poor man",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"As I went upstairs after dinner, two of the young men were settling",Little Women

514,few bits of news and was introduced to the Professor.  It seems that,Little Women
514,Tina is the child of the Frenchwoman who does the fine ironing in the,Little Women
514,"laundry here.  The little thing has lost her heart to Mr. Bhaer, and",Little Women
514,"follows him about the house like a dog whenever he is at home, which",Little Women
514,"delights him, as he is very fond of children, though a 'bacheldore'.",Little Women
514,"Kitty and Minnie Kirke likewise regard him with affection, and tell all",Little Women
514,"sorts of stories about the plays he invents, the presents he brings,",Little Women
514,"and the splendid tales he tells.  The younger men quiz him, it seems,",Little Women
514,"call him Old Fritz, Lager Beer, Ursa Major, and make all manner of",Little Women
514,"jokes on his name.  But he enjoys it like a boy, Mrs. Kirke says, and",Little Women

514,"has fine books and pictures, knows interesting persons, and seems",Little Women

514,"you said nothing about a parcel, meaning it for a surprise, so I was",Little Women

514,"the silent, haughty Miss March (for they think I am very stiff and",Little Women

514,"Though very happy in the social atmosphere about her, and very busy",Little Women
514,with the daily work that earned her bread and made it sweeter for the,Little Women

514,"more than life.  The dream of filling home with comforts, giving Beth",Little Women
514,"everything she wanted, from strawberries in winter to an organ in her",Little Women
514,"bedroom, going abroad herself, and always having more than enough, so",Little Women
514,"that she might indulge in the luxury of charity, had been for years",Little Women
514,Jo's most cherished castle in the air.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The prize-story experience had seemed to open a way which might, after",Little Women
514,"long traveling and much uphill work, lead to this delightful chateau en",Little Women
514,"Espagne.  But the novel disaster quenched her courage for a time, for",Little Women
514,public opinion is a giant which has frightened stouter-hearted Jacks on,Little Women
514,"bigger beanstalks than hers. Like that immortal hero, she reposed",Little Women
514,"awhile after the first attempt, which resulted in a tumble and the",Little Women
514,"least lovely of the giant's treasures, if I remember rightly.  But the",Little Women
514,"'up again and take another' spirit was as strong in Jo as in Jack, so",Little Women
514,"she scrambled up on the shady side this time and got more booty, but",Little Women
514,nearly left behind her what was far more precious than the moneybags.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She took to writing sensation stories, for in those dark ages, even",Little Women
514,"all-perfect America read rubbish.  She told no one, but concocted a",Little Women
514,"'thrilling tale', and boldly carried it herself to Mr. Dashwood, editor",Little Women
514,"of the Weekly Volcano.  She had never read Sartor Resartus, but she had",Little Women
514,a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful over,Little Women
514,many than the worth of character or the magic of manners.  So she,Little Women
514,"dressed herself in her best, and trying to persuade herself that she",Little Women
514,"was neither excited nor nervous, bravely climbed two pairs of dark and",Little Women
514,"dirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room, a cloud of cigar",Little Women
514,"smoke, and the presence of three gentlemen, sitting with their heels",Little Women
514,"rather higher than their hats, which articles of dress none of them",Little Women
514,took the trouble to remove on her appearance.  Somewhat daunted by this,Little Women
514,"reception, Jo hesitated on the threshold, murmuring in much",Little Women
514,embarrassment...,Little Women

514,"Down went the highest pair of heels, up rose the smokiest gentleman,",Little Women
514,"and carefully cherishing his cigar between his fingers, he advanced",Little Women
514,with a nod and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep.  Feeling,Little Women
514,"that she must get through the matter somehow, Jo produced her",Little Women
514,"manuscript and, blushing redder and redder with each sentence,",Little Women
514,blundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the,Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"While she blushed and blundered, Mr. Dashwood had taken the manuscript,",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Now, Jo did _not_ like to leave it, for Mr. Dashwood didn't suit her at",Little Women

514,"bow and walk away, looking particularly tall and dignified, as she was",Little Women
514,"apt to do when nettled or abashed. Just then she was both, for it was",Little Women
514,perfectly evident from the knowing glances exchanged among the,Little Women
514,gentlemen that her little fiction of 'my friend' was considered a good,Little Women
514,"joke, and a laugh, produced by some inaudible remark of the editor, as",Little Women
514,"he closed the door, completed her discomfiture.  Half resolving never",Little Women
514,"to return, she went home, and worked off her irritation by stitching",Little Women

514,"""Very well, you can have it,"" said Jo, handing back the story with a",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Following Mr. Dashwood's directions, and making Mrs. Northbury her",Little Women
514,"model, Jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational",Little Women

514,she came up again not much the worse for her ducking.,Little Women

514,"Like most young scribblers, she went abroad for her characters and",Little Women

514,as could be expected.  Her readers were not particular about such,Little Women
514,"trifles as grammar, punctuation, and probability, and Mr. Dashwood",Little Women
514,"graciously permitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices, not",Little Women
514,thinking it necessary to tell her that the real cause of his,Little Women
514,"hospitality was the fact that one of his hacks, on being offered higher",Little Women
514,"wages, had basely left him in the lurch.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She soon became interested in her work, for her emaciated purse grew",Little Women
514,"stout, and the little hoard she was making to take Beth to the",Little Women

514,"thing disturbed her satisfaction, and that was that she did not tell",Little Women
514,them at home.  She had a feeling that Father and Mother would not,Little Women
514,"approve, and preferred to have her own way first, and beg pardon",Little Women
514,"afterward.  It was easy to keep her secret, for no name appeared with",Little Women
514,"her stories.  Mr. Dashwood had of course found it out very soon, but",Little Women
514,"promised to be dumb, and for a wonder kept his word.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She thought it would do her no harm, for she sincerely meant to write",Little Women
514,"nothing of which she would be ashamed, and quieted all pricks of",Little Women
514,conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show,Little Women
514,her earnings and laugh over her well-kept secret.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"But Mr. Dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales, and as thrills could",Little Women

514,"history and romance, land and sea, science and art, police records and",Little Women
514,"lunatic asylums, had to be ransacked for the purpose.  Jo soon found",Little Women
514,that her innocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the,Little Women
514,"tragic world which underlies society, so regarding it in a business",Little Women
514,"light, she set about supplying her deficiencies with characteristic",Little Women
514,"energy. Eager to find material for stories, and bent on making them",Little Women
514,"original in plot, if not masterly in execution, she searched newspapers",Little Women
514,"for accidents, incidents, and crimes.  She excited the suspicions of",Little Women
514,public librarians by asking for works on poisons.  She studied faces in,Little Women
514,"the street, and characters, good, bad, and indifferent, all about her.",Little Women
514,She delved in the dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old,Little Women
514,"that they were as good as new, and introduced herself to folly, sin,",Little Women
514,"and misery, as well as her limited opportunities allowed.  She thought",Little Women
514,"she was prospering finely, but unconsciously she was beginning to",Little Women
514,desecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a woman's character.,Little Women
514,"She was living in bad society, and imaginary though it was, its",Little Women
514,"influence affected her, for she was feeding heart and fancy on",Little Women
514,"dangerous and unsubstantial food, and was fast brushing the innocent",Little Women
514,bloom from her nature by a premature acquaintance with the darker side,Little Women
514,"of life, which comes soon enough to all of us.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She was beginning to feel rather than see this, for much describing of",Little Women
514,other people's passions and feelings set her to studying and,Little Women
514,"speculating about her own, a morbid amusement in which healthy young",Little Women
514,minds do not voluntarily indulge. Wrongdoing always brings its own,Little Women
514,"punishment, and when Jo most needed hers, she got it.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,I don't know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her to read,Little Women
514,"character, or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest,",Little Women
514,"brave, and strong, but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every",Little Women
514,"perfection under the sun, Jo was discovering a live hero, who",Little Women
514,"interested her in spite of many human imperfections.  Mr. Bhaer, in one",Little Women
514,"of their conversations, had advised her to study simple, true, and",Little Women
514,"lovely characters, wherever she found them, as good training for a",Little Women
514,"writer.  Jo took him at his word, for she coolly turned round and",Little Women
514,"studied him--a proceeding which would have much surprised him, had he",Little Women
514,"known it, for the worthy Professor was very humble in his own conceit.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Why everybody liked him was what puzzled Jo, at first.  He was neither",Little Women
514,"rich nor great, young nor handsome, in no respect what is called",Little Women
514,"fascinating, imposing, or brilliant, and yet he was as attractive as a",Little Women
514,"genial fire, and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as",Little Women
514,"about a warm hearth.  He was poor, yet always appeared to be giving",Little Women
514,"something away; a stranger, yet everyone was his friend; no longer",Little Women
514,"young, but as happy-hearted as a boy; plain and peculiar, yet his face",Little Women
514,"looked beautiful to many, and his oddities were freely forgiven for his",Little Women
514,"sake.  Jo often watched him, trying to discover the charm, and at last",Little Women
514,decided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle.  If he had,Little Women
514,"any sorrow, 'it sat with its head under its wing', and he turned only",Little Women
514,"his sunny side to the world.  There were lines upon his forehead, but",Little Women
514,"Time seemed to have touched him gently, remembering how kind he was to",Little Women
514,others.  The pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials of many,Little Women
514,"friendly words and cheery laughs, his eyes were never cold or hard, and",Little Women
514,"his big hand had a warm, strong grasp that was more expressive than",Little Women
514,words.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,His very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the,Little Women
514,"wearer.  They looked as if they were at ease, and liked to make him",Little Women
514,comfortable.  His capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart,Little Women
514,"underneath.  His rusty coat had a social air, and the baggy pockets",Little Women
514,plainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full.,Little Women
514,"His very boots were benevolent, and his collars never stiff and raspy",Little Women
514,like other people's.,Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Jo valued goodness highly, but she also possessed a most feminine",Little Women
514,"respect for intellect, and a little discovery which she made about the",Little Women

514,and no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much,Little Women
514,"honored and esteemed for learning and integrity, till a countryman came",Little Women
514,"to see him. He never spoke of himself, and in a conversation with Miss",Little Women
514,"Norton divulged the pleasing fact.  From her Jo learned it, and liked",Little Women
514,it all the better because Mr. Bhaer had never told it.  She felt proud,Little Women
514,"to know that he was an honored Professor in Berlin, though only a poor",Little Women
514,"language-master in America, and his homely, hard-working life was much",Little Women
514,beautified by the spice of romance which this discovery gave it.,Little Women
514,Another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most,Little Women
514,"unexpected manner.  Miss Norton had the entree into most society, which",Little Women
514,Jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her.  The solitary woman,Little Women
514,"felt an interest in the ambitious girl, and kindly conferred many",Little Women
514,favors of this sort both on Jo and the Professor.  She took them with,Little Women
514,"her one night to a select symposium, held in honor of several",Little Women
514,celebrities.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had,Little Women
514,worshiped with youthful enthusiasm afar off.  But her reverence for,Little Women
514,"genius received a severe shock that night, and it took her some time to",Little Women
514,recover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and,Little Women
514,"women after all.  Imagine her dismay, on stealing a glance of timid",Little Women
514,admiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on,Little Women
514,"'spirit, fire, and dew', to behold him devouring his supper with an",Little Women
514,ardor which flushed his intellectual countenance.  Turning as from a,Little Women
514,"fallen idol, she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her",Little Women
514,romantic illusions.  The great novelist vibrated between two decanters,Little Women
514,with the regularity of a pendulum; the famous divine flirted openly,Little Women
514,"with one of the Madame de Staels of the age, who looked daggers at",Little Women
514,"another Corinne, who was amiably satirizing her, after outmaneuvering",Little Women
514,"her in efforts to absorb the profound philosopher, who imbibed tea",Little Women
514,"Johnsonianly and appeared to slumber, the loquacity of the lady",Little Women
514,"rendering speech impossible.  The scientific celebrities, forgetting",Little Women
514,"their mollusks and glacial periods, gossiped about art, while devoting",Little Women
514,themselves to oysters and ices with characteristic energy; the young,Little Women
514,"musician, who was charming the city like a second Orpheus, talked",Little Women
514,horses; and the specimen of the British nobility present happened to be,Little Women
514,the most ordinary man of the party.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Before the evening was half over, Jo felt so completely disillusioned,",Little Women
514,that she sat down in a corner to recover herself. Mr. Bhaer soon joined,Little Women
514,"her, looking rather out of his element, and presently several of the",Little Women
514,"philosophers, each mounted on his hobby, came ambling up to hold an",Little Women
514,intellectual tournament in the recess.  The conversations were miles,Little Women
514,"beyond Jo's comprehension, but she enjoyed it, though Kant and Hegel",Little Women
514,"were unknown gods, the Subjective and Objective unintelligible terms,",Little Women
514,and the only thing 'evolved from her inner consciousness' was a bad,Little Women
514,headache after it was all over.  It dawned upon her gradually that the,Little Women
514,"world was being picked to pieces, and put together on new and,",Little Women
514,"according to the talkers, on infinitely better principles than before,",Little Women
514,"that religion was in a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness, and",Little Women
514,intellect was to be the only God.  Jo knew nothing about philosophy or,Little Women
514,"metaphysics of any sort, but a curious excitement, half pleasurable,",Little Women
514,"half painful, came over her as she listened with a sense of being",Little Women
514,"turned adrift into time and space, like a young balloon out on a",Little Women
514,holiday.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She looked round to see how the Professor liked it, and found him",Little Women
514,looking at her with the grimmest expression she had ever seen him wear.,Little Women
514,"He shook his head and beckoned her to come away, but she was fascinated",Little Women
514,"just then by the freedom of Speculative Philosophy, and kept her seat,",Little Women
514,trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to rely upon after,Little Women
514,they had annihilated all the old beliefs.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Now, Mr. Bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his own opinions,",Little Women
514,"not because they were unsettled, but too sincere and earnest to be",Little Women
514,"lightly spoken.  As he glanced from Jo to several other young people,",Little Women
514,"attracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics, he knit",Little Women
514,"his brows and longed to speak, fearing that some inflammable young soul",Little Women
514,"would be led astray by the rockets, to find when the display was over",Little Women
514,that they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He bore it as long as he could, but when he was appealed to for an",Little Women
514,"opinion, he blazed up with honest indignation and defended religion",Little Women
514,with all the eloquence of truth--an eloquence which made his broken,Little Women
514,"English musical and his plain face beautiful.  He had a hard fight, for",Little Women
514,"the wise men argued well, but he didn't know when he was beaten and",Little Women
514,"stood to his colors like a man.  Somehow, as he talked, the world got",Little Women
514,"right again to Jo.  The old beliefs, that had lasted so long, seemed",Little Women
514,"better than the new.  God was not a blind force, and immortality was",Little Women
514,"not a pretty fable, but a blessed fact.  She felt as if she had solid",Little Women
514,"ground under her feet again, and when Mr. Bhaer paused, outtalked but",Little Women
514,"not one whit convinced, Jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She did neither, but she remembered the scene, and gave the Professor",Little Women
514,"her heartiest respect, for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out",Little Women
514,"then and there, because his conscience would not let him be silent.",Little Women
514,"She began to see that character is a better possession than money,",Little Women
514,"rank, intellect, or beauty, and to feel that if greatness is what a",Little Women
514,"wise man has defined it to be, 'truth, reverence, and good will', then",Little Women
514,"her friend Friedrich Bhaer was not only good, but great.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"This belief strengthened daily.  She valued his esteem, she coveted his",Little Women
514,"respect, she wanted to be worthy of his friendship, and just when the",Little Women
514,"wish was sincerest, she came near to losing everything.  It all grew",Little Women
514,"out of a cocked hat, for one evening the Professor came in to give Jo",Little Women
514,"her lesson with a paper soldier cap on his head, which Tina had put",Little Women
514,there and he had forgotten to take off.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's evident he doesn't look in his glass before coming down,"" thought",Little Women
514,"Jo, with a smile, as he said ""Goot efening,"" and sat soberly down,",Little Women
514,quite unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his,Little Women
514,"headgear, for he was going to read her the Death of Wallenstein.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She said nothing at first, for she liked to hear him laugh out his big,",Little Women
514,"hearty laugh when anything funny happened, so she left him to discover",Little Women
514,"it for himself, and presently forgot all about it, for to hear a German",Little Women
514,read Schiller is rather an absorbing occupation.  After the reading,Little Women
514,"came the lesson, which was a lively one, for Jo was in a gay mood that",Little Women
514,"night, and the cocked hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment.  The",Little Women
514,"Professor didn't know what to make of her, and stopped at last to ask",Little Women
514,with an air of mild surprise that was irresistible. . .,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Mees Marsch, for what do you laugh in your master's face? Haf you no",Little Women
514,"respect for me, that you go on so bad?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How can I be respectful, Sir, when you forget to take your hat off?""",Little Women
514,said Jo.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Lifting his hand to his head, the absent-minded Professor gravely felt",Little Women
514,"and removed the little cocked hat, looked at it a minute, and then",Little Women
514,threw back his head and laughed like a merry bass viol.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Ah!  I see him now, it is that imp Tina who makes me a fool with my",Little Women
514,"cap.  Well, it is nothing, but see you, if this lesson goes not well,",Little Women
514,"you too shall wear him.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,But the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because Mr. Bhaer,Little Women
514,"caught sight of a picture on the hat, and unfolding it, said with great",Little Women
514,"disgust, ""I wish these papers did not come in the house.  They are not",Little Women
514,"for children to see,  nor young people to read. It is not well, and I",Little Women
514,"haf no patience with those who make this harm.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Jo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a,Little Women
514,"lunatic, a corpse, a villain, and a viper.  She did not like it, but",Little Women
514,the impulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure but,Little Women
514,"fear, because for a minute she fancied the paper was the Volcano.  It",Little Women
514,"was not, however, and her panic subsided as she remembered that even if",Little Women
514,"it had been and one of her own tales in it, there would have been no",Little Women
514,"name to betray her.  She had betrayed herself, however, by a look and a",Little Women
514,"blush, for though an absent man, the Professor saw a good deal more",Little Women
514,"than people fancied.  He knew that Jo wrote, and had met her down among",Little Women
514,"the newspaper offices more than once, but as she never spoke of it, he",Little Women
514,asked no questions in spite of a strong desire to see her work.  Now it,Little Women
514,"occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own, and it",Little Women
514,"troubled him.  He did not say to himself, ""It is none of my business.",Little Women
514,"I've no right to say anything,"" as many people would have done.  He",Little Women
514,"only remembered that she was young and poor, a girl far away from",Little Women
514,"mother's love and father's care, and he was moved to help her with an",Little Women
514,impulse as quick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out,Little Women
514,his hand to save a baby from a puddle.  All this flashed through his,Little Women
514,"mind in a minute, but not a trace of it appeared in his face, and by",Little Women
514,"the time the paper was turned, and Jo's needle threaded, he was ready",Little Women
514,"to say quite naturally, but very gravely...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, you are right to put it from you.  I do not think that good young",Little Women
514,"girls should see such things.  They are made pleasant to some, but I",Little Women
514,would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than this bad,Little Women
514,"trash.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""All may not be bad, only silly, you know, and if there is a demand for",Little Women
514,"it, I don't see any harm in supplying it. Many very respectable people",Little Women
514,"make an honest living out of what are called sensation stories,"" said",Little Women
514,"Jo, scratching gathers so energetically that a row of little slits",Little Women
514,followed her pin.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""There is a demand for whisky, but I think you and I do not care to",Little Women
514,"sell it.  If the respectable people knew what harm they did, they would",Little Women
514,not feel that the living was honest.  They haf no right to put poison,Little Women
514,"in the sugarplum, and let the small ones eat it.  No, they should think",Little Women
514,"a little, and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Mr. Bhaer spoke warmly, and walked to the fire, crumpling the paper in",Little Women
514,"his hands.  Jo sat still, looking as if the fire had come to her, for",Little Women
514,her cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke and,Little Women
514,gone harmlessly up the chimney.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I should like much to send all the rest after him,"" muttered the",Little Women
514,"Professor, coming back with a relieved air.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make, and her",Little Women
514,hard-earned money lay rather heavily on her conscience at that minute.,Little Women
514,"Then she thought consolingly to herself, ""Mine are not like that, they",Little Women
514,"are only silly, never bad, so I won't be worried,"" and taking up her",Little Women
514,"book, she said, with a studious face, ""Shall we go on, Sir? I'll be",Little Women
514,"very good and proper now.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I shall hope so,"" was all he said, but he meant more than she",Little Women
514,"imagined, and the grave, kind look he gave her made her feel as if the",Little Women
514,words Weekly Volcano were printed in large type on her forehead.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As soon as she went to her room, she got out her papers, and carefully",Little Women
514,"reread every one of her stories.  Being a little shortsighted, Mr.",Little Women
514,"Bhaer sometimes used eye glasses, and Jo had tried them once, smiling",Little Women
514,to see how they magnified the fine print of her book.  Now she seemed,Little Women
514,"to have on the Professor's mental or moral spectacles also, for the",Little Women
514,faults of these poor stories glared at her dreadfully and filled her,Little Women
514,with dismay.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""They are trash, and will soon be worse trash if I go on, for each is",Little Women
514,"more sensational than the last.  I've gone blindly on, hurting myself",Little Women
514,"and other people, for the sake of money.  I know it's so, for I can't",Little Women
514,"read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of it,",Little Women
514,and what should I do if they were seen at home or Mr. Bhaer got hold of,Little Women
514,"them?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo turned hot at the bare idea, and stuffed the whole bundle into her",Little Women
514,"stove, nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, that's the best place for such inflammable nonsense. I'd better",Little Women
514,"burn the house down, I suppose, than let other people blow themselves",Little Women
514,"up with my gunpowder,"" she thought as she watched the Demon of the Jura",Little Women
514,"whisk away, a little black cinder with fiery eyes.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,But when nothing remained of all her three month's work except a heap,Little Women
514,"of ashes and the money in her lap, Jo looked sober, as she sat on the",Little Women
514,"floor, wondering what she ought to do about her wages.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I think I haven't done much harm yet, and may keep this to pay for my",Little Women
514,"time,"" she said, after a long meditation, adding impatiently, ""I almost",Little Women
514,"wish I hadn't any conscience, it's so inconvenient.  If I didn't care",Little Women
514,"about doing right, and didn't feel uncomfortable when doing wrong, I",Little Women
514,"should get on capitally. I can't help wishing sometimes, that Mother",Little Women
514,"and Father hadn't been so particular about such things.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Ah, Jo, instead of wishing that, thank God that 'Father and Mother were",Little Women
514,"particular', and pity from your heart those who have no such guardians",Little Women
514,to hedge them round with principles which may seem like prison walls to,Little Women
514,"impatient youth, but which will prove sure foundations to build",Little Women
514,character upon in womanhood.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo wrote no more sensational stories, deciding that the money did not",Little Women
514,"pay for her share of the sensation, but going to the other extreme, as",Little Women
514,"is the way with people of her stamp, she took a course of Mrs.",Little Women
514,"Sherwood, Miss Edgeworth, and Hannah More, and then produced a tale",Little Women
514,"which might have been more properly called an essay or a sermon, so",Little Women
514,intensely moral was it.  She had her doubts about it from the,Little Women
514,"beginning, for her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease",Little Women
514,in the new style as she would have done masquerading in the stiff and,Little Women
514,cumbrous costume of the last century.  She sent this didactic gem to,Little Women
514,"several markets, but it found no purchaser, and she was inclined to",Little Women
514,agree with Mr. Dashwood that morals didn't sell.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Then she tried a child's story, which she could easily have disposed of",Little Women
514,if she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it.,Little Women
514,The only person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try,Little Women
514,juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to,Little Women
514,convert all the world to his particular belief.  But much as she liked,Little Women
514,"to write for children, Jo could not consent to depict all her naughty",Little Women
514,boys as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls because they did,Little Women
514,"not go to a particular Sabbath school, nor all the good infants who did",Little Women
514,"go as rewarded by every kind of bliss, from gilded gingerbread to",Little Women
514,escorts of angels when they departed this life with psalms or sermons,Little Women
514,"on their lisping tongues.  So nothing came of these trials, and Jo",Little Women
514,"corked up her inkstand, and said in a fit of very wholesome humility...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I don't know anything.  I'll wait until I do before I try again, and",Little Women
514,"meantime, 'sweep mud in the street' if I can't do better, that's",Little Women
514,"honest, at least.""  Which decision proved that her second tumble down",Little Women
514,the beanstalk had done her some good.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"While these internal revolutions were going on, her external life had",Little Women
514,"been as busy and uneventful as usual, and if she sometimes looked",Little Women
514,serious or a little sad no one observed it but Professor Bhaer.  He did,Little Women
514,it so quietly that Jo never knew he was watching to see if she would,Little Women
514,"accept and profit by his reproof, but she stood the test, and he was",Little Women
514,"satisfied, for though no words passed between them, he knew that she",Little Women
514,had given up writing.  Not only did he guess it by the fact that the,Little Women
514,"second finger of her right hand was no longer inky, but she spent her",Little Women
514,"evenings downstairs now, was met no more among newspaper offices, and",Little Women
514,"studied with a dogged patience, which assured him that she was bent on",Little Women
514,"occupying her mind with something useful, if not pleasant.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He helped her in many ways, proving himself a true friend, and Jo was",Little Women
514,"happy, for while her pen lay idle, she was learning other lessons",Little Women
514,"besides German, and laying a foundation for the sensation story of her",Little Women
514,own life.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It was a pleasant winter and a long one, for she did not leave Mrs.",Little Women
514,Kirke till June.  Everyone seemed sorry when the time came.  The,Little Women

514,"over his head, for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Going home?  Ah, you are happy that you haf a home to go in,"" he said,",Little Women

514,while she held a little levee on that last evening.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She was going early, so she bade them all goodbye overnight, and when",Little Women

514,"him.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo looked up then, quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure",Little Women
514,in the prospect of showing them to one another. Something in Mr.,Little Women
514,Bhaer's face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find Laurie more,Little Women
514,"than a 'best friend', and simply because she particularly wished not to",Little Women
514,"look as if anything was the matter, she involuntarily began to blush,",Little Women
514,"and the more she tried not to, the redder she grew.  If it had not been",Little Women
514,for Tina on her knee.  She didn't know what would have become of her.,Little Women
514,"Fortunately the child was moved to hug her, so she managed to hide her",Little Women
514,"face an instant, hoping the Professor did not see it. But he did, and",Little Women
514,his own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual,Little Women
514,"expression, as he said cordially...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I fear I shall not make the time for that, but I wish the friend much",Little Women
514,"success, and you all happiness.  Gott bless you!""  And with that, he",Little Women
514,"shook hands warmly, shouldered Tina, and went away.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"But after the boys were abed, he sat long before his fire with the",Little Women
514,"tired look on his face and the 'heimweh', or homesickness, lying heavy",Little Women
514,"at his heart.  Once, when he remembered Jo as she sat with the little",Little Women
514,"child in her lap and that new softness in her face, he leaned his head",Little Women
514,"on his hands a minute, and then roamed about the room, as if in search",Little Women
514,of something that he could not find.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It is not for me, I must not hope it now,"" he said to himself, with a",Little Women
514,"sigh that was almost a groan.  Then, as if reproaching himself for the",Little Women
514,"longing that he could not repress, he went and kissed the two tousled",Little Women
514,"heads upon the pillow, took down his seldom-used meerschaum, and opened",Little Women
514,his Plato.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He did his best and did it manfully, but I don't think he found that a",Little Women

514,"""Oh, deary me!  I know he'll say something, and then what shall I do?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears, and",Little Women
514,having decided that she wouldn't be vain enough to think people were,Little Women
514,going to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her,Little Women
514,"answer would be, she set forth at the appointed time, hoping Teddy",Little Women
514,wouldn't do anything to make her hurt his poor feelings.  A call at,Little Women
514,"Meg's, and a refreshing sniff and sip at the Daisy and Demijohn, still",Little Women
514,"further fortified her for the tete-a-tete, but when she saw a stalwart",Little Women
514,"figure looming in the distance, she had a strong desire to turn about",Little Women
514,and run away.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Where's the jew's-harp, Jo?"" cried Laurie, as soon as he was within",Little Women
514,speaking distance.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I forgot it."" And Jo took heart again, for that salutation could not",Little Women
514,be called lover-like.,Little Women

514,"She always used to take his arm on these occasions, now she did not,",Little Women
514,"and he made no complaint, which was a bad sign, but talked on rapidly",Little Women
514,"about all sorts of faraway subjects, till they turned from the road",Little Women
514,into the little path that led homeward through the grove.  Then he,Little Women
514,"walked more slowly, suddenly lost his fine flow of language, and now",Little Women
514,and then a dreadful pause occurred.  To rescue the conversation from,Little Women
514,"one of the wells of silence into which it kept falling, Jo said",Little Women
514,"hastily, ""Now you must have a good long holiday!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I intend to.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Something in his resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to find him,Little Women

514,"Teddy.  Please don't!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I will, and you must hear me.  It's no use, Jo, we've got to have it",Little Women
514,"out, and the sooner the better for both of us,"" he answered, getting",Little Women
514,flushed and excited all at once.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Say what you like then.  I'll listen,"" said Jo, with a desperate sort",Little Women
514,of patience.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie was a young lover, but he was in earnest, and meant to 'have it",Little Women
514,"out', if he died in the attempt, so he plunged into the subject with",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""I know you did, but the girls are so queer you never know what they",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"They were in the grove now, close by the stile, and when the last words",Little Women

514,the decided answer.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"There was a long pause, while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow",Little Women
514,"by the river, and the tall grass rustled in the wind. Presently Jo said",Little Women
514,"very soberly, as she sat down on the step of the stile, ""Laurie, I want",Little Women
514,"to tell you something.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He started as if he had been shot, threw up his head, and cried out in",Little Women

514,,Little Women

514,in his eyes.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo wanted to laugh, but restrained herself and said warmly, for she",Little Women
514,"too, was getting excited with all this, ""Don't swear, Teddy!  He isn't",Little Women
514,"old, nor anything bad, but good and kind, and the best friend I've got,",Little Women
514,"next to you.  Pray, don't fly into a passion.  I want to be kind, but I",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""What shall I do with him?"" sighed Jo, finding that emotions were more",Little Women
514,"unmanagable than she expected.  ""You haven't heard what I wanted to",Little Women
514,"tell you.  Sit down and listen, for indeed I want to do right and make",Little Women
514,"you happy,"" she said, hoping to soothe him with a little reason, which",Little Women
514,proved that she knew nothing about love.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Seeing a ray of hope in that last speech, Laurie threw himself down on",Little Women
514,"the grass at her feet, leaned his arm on the lower step of the stile,",Little Women
514,and looked up at her with an expectant face. Now that arrangement was,Little Women
514,"not conducive to calm speech or clear thought on Jo's part, for how",Little Women
514,could she say hard things to her boy while he watched her with eyes,Little Women
514,"full of love and longing, and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or",Little Women
514,two her hardness of heart had wrung from him?  She gently turned his,Little Women
514,"head away, saying, as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed",Little Women
514,"to grow for her sake--how touching that was, to be sure! ""I agree with",Little Women
514,"Mother that you and I are not suited to each other, because our quick",Little Women
514,"tempers and strong wills would probably make us very miserable, if we",Little Women
514,"were so foolish as to..."" Jo paused a little over the last word, but",Little Women
514,Laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression.,Little Women

514,"""No, I can't.  I've tried and failed, and I won't risk our happiness by",Little Women
514,"such a serious experiment.  We don't agree and we never shall, so we'll",Little Women
514,"be good friends all our lives, but we won't go and do anything rash.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, we will if we get the chance,"" muttered Laurie rebelliously.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Now do be reasonable, and take a sensible view of the case,"" implored",Little Women
514,"Jo, almost at her wit's end.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I won't be reasonable.  I don't want to take what you call 'a sensible",Little Women
514,"view'.  It won't help me, and it only makes it harder.  I don't believe",Little Women
514,"you've got any heart.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I wish I hadn't.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"There was a little quiver in Jo's voice, and thinking it a good omen,",Little Women
514,"Laurie turned round, bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he",Little Women
514,"said, in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously",Little Women
514,"wheedlesome before, ""Don't disappoint us, dear!  Everyone expects it.",Little Women
514,"Grandpa has set his heart upon it, your people like it, and I can't get",Little Women
514,"on without you.  Say you will, and let's be happy.  Do, do!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Not until months afterward did Jo understand how she had the strength,Little Women
514,of mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided,Little Women
514,"that she did not love her boy, and never could.  It was very hard to",Little Women
514,"do, but she did it, knowing that delay was both useless and cruel.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I can't say 'yes' truly, so I won't say it at all.  You'll see that",Little Women
514,"I'm right, by-and-by, and thank me for it..."" she began solemnly.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll be hanged if I do!"" and Laurie bounced up off the grass, burning",Little Women
514,with indignation at the very idea.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, you will!"" persisted Jo.  ""You'll get over this after a while,",Little Women
514,"and find some lovely accomplished girl, who will adore you, and make a",Little Women
514,fine mistress for your fine house.  I shouldn't. I'm homely and awkward,Little Women
514,"and odd and old, and you'd be ashamed of me, and we should quarrel--we",Little Women
514,"can't help it even now, you see--and I shouldn't like elegant society",Little Women
514,"and you would, and you'd hate my scribbling, and I couldn't get on",Little Women
514,"without it, and we should be unhappy, and wish we hadn't done it, and",Little Women
514,"everything would be horrid!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Anything more?"" asked Laurie, finding it hard to listen patiently to",Little Women
514,this prophetic burst.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Nothing more, except that I don't believe I shall ever marry.  I'm",Little Women
514,"happy as I am, and love my liberty too well to be in a hurry to give it",Little Women
514,"up for any mortal man.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I know better!"" broke in Laurie.  ""You think so now, but there'll come",Little Women
514,"a time when you will care for somebody, and you'll love him",Little Women
514,"tremendously, and live and die for him.  I know you will, it's your",Little Women
514,"way, and I shall have to stand by and see it,"" and the despairing lover",Little Women
514,cast his hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed,Little Women
514,"comical, if his face had not been so tragic.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, I will live and die for him, if he ever comes and makes me love",Little Women
514,"him in spite of myself, and you must do the best you can!"" cried Jo,",Little Women
514,"losing patience with poor Teddy.  ""I've done my best, but you won't be",Little Women
514,"reasonable, and it's selfish of you to keep teasing for what I can't",Little Women
514,"give.  I shall always be fond of you, very fond indeed, as a friend,",Little Women
514,"but I'll never marry you, and the sooner you believe it the better for",Little Women
514,"both of us--so now!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,That speech was like gunpowder.  Laurie looked at her a minute as if he,Little Women
514,"did not quite know what to do with himself, then turned sharply away,",Little Women
514,"saying in a desperate sort of tone, ""You'll be sorry some day, Jo.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, where are you going?"" she cried, for his face frightened her.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""To the devil!"" was the consoling answer.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"For a minute Jo's heart stood still, as he swung himself down the bank",Little Women
514,"toward the river, but it takes much folly, sin or misery to send a",Little Women
514,"young man to a violent death, and Laurie was not one of the weak sort",Little Women
514,who are conquered by a single failure.  He had no thought of a,Little Women
514,"melodramatic plunge, but some blind instinct led him to fling hat and",Little Women
514,"coat into his boat, and row away with all his might, making better time",Little Women
514,up the river than he had done in any race.  Jo drew a long breath and,Little Women
514,unclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip,Little Women
514,the trouble which he carried in his heart.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That will do him good, and he'll come home in such a tender, penitent",Little Women
514,"state of mind, that I shan't dare to see him,"" she said, adding, as she",Little Women
514,"went slowly home, feeling as if she had murdered some innocent thing,",Little Women
514,"and buried it under the leaves.  ""Now I must go and prepare Mr.",Little Women
514,"Laurence to be very kind to my poor boy.  I wish he'd love Beth,",Little Women
514,"perhaps he may in time, but I begin to think I was mistaken about her.",Little Women
514,Oh dear!  How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them?  I think,Little Women
514,"it's dreadful.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Being sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she went",Little Women
514,"straight to Mr. Laurence, told the hard story bravely through, and then",Little Women
514,"broke down, crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind",Little Women
514,"old gentleman, though sorely disappointed, did not utter a reproach.",Little Women
514,He found it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving,Little Women
514,"Laurie, and hoped she would change her mind, but he knew even better",Little Women
514,"than Jo that love cannot be forced, so he shook his head sadly and",Little Women
514,"resolved to carry his boy out of harm's way, for Young Impetuosity's",Little Women
514,parting words to Jo disturbed him more than he would confess.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"When Laurie came home, dead tired but quite composed, his grandfather",Little Women
514,"met him as if he knew nothing, and kept up the delusion very",Little Women
514,successfully for an hour or two.  But when they sat together in the,Little Women
514,"twilight, the time they used to enjoy so much, it was hard work for the",Little Women
514,"old man to ramble on as usual, and harder still for the young one to",Little Women
514,"listen to praises of the last year's success, which to him now seemed",Little Women
514,"like love's labor lost.  He bore it as long as he could, then went to",Little Women
514,"his piano and began to play.  The windows were open, and Jo, walking",Little Women
514,"in the garden with Beth, for once understood music better than her",Little Women
514,"sister, for he played the '_Sonata Pathetique_', and played it as he",Little Women
514,never did before.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That's very fine, I dare say, but it's sad enough to make one cry.",Little Women
514,"Give us something gayer, lad,"" said Mr. Laurence, whose kind old heart",Little Women
514,"was full of sympathy, which he longed to show but knew not how.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie dashed into a livelier strain, played stormily for several",Little Women
514,"minutes, and would have got through bravely, if in a momentary lull",Little Women
514,"Mrs. March's voice had not been heard calling, ""Jo, dear, come in.  I",Little Women
514,"want you.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Just what Laurie longed to say, with a different meaning! As he",Little Women
514,"listened, he lost his place, the music ended with a broken chord, and",Little Women
514,the musician sat silent in the dark.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I can't stand this,"" muttered the old gentleman.  Up he got, groped",Little Women
514,"his way to the piano, laid a kind hand on either of the broad",Little Women
514,"shoulders, and said, as gently as a woman, ""I know, my boy, I know.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"No answer for an instant, then Laurie asked sharply, ""Who told you?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Jo herself.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Then there's an end of it!""  And he shook off his grandfather's hands",Little Women
514,"with an impatient motion, for though grateful for the sympathy, his",Little Women
514,man's pride could not bear a man's pity.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not quite.  I want to say one thing, and then there shall be an end of",Little Women
514,"it,"" returned Mr. Laurence with unusual mildness. ""You won't care to",Little Women
514,"stay at home now, perhaps?""",Little Women

514,in a defiant tone.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not if you are the gentleman I think you.  I'm disappointed, but the",Little Women

514,"for a time.  Where will you go?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Anywhere.  I don't care what becomes of me,"" and Laurie got up with a",Little Women
514,reckless laugh that grated on his grandfather's ear.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Take it like a man, and don't do anything rash, for God's sake.  Why",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Myself.""",Little Women

514,"just sit quietly down and hear my plan.  It's all settled, and can be",Little Women

514,"""There is business in London that needs looking after.  I meant you",Little Women
514,"should attend to it, but I can do it better myself, and things here",Little Women

514,"can be off at any time.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"The old gentleman knew that perfectly well, and particularly desired to",Little Women
514,"prevent it, for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him",Little Women
514,"that it would not be wise to leave him to his own devices.  So,",Little Women
514,stifling a natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would,Little Women
514,"leave behind him, he said stoutly, ""Bless your soul, I'm not",Little Women
514,"superannuated yet.  I quite enjoy the idea.  It will do me good, and my",Little Women
514,"old bones won't suffer, for traveling nowadays is almost as easy as",Little Women
514,"sitting in a chair.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"A restless movement from Laurie suggested that his chair was not easy,",Little Women
514,"or that he did not like the plan, and made the old man add hastily, ""I",Little Women
514,don't mean to be a marplot or a burden. I go because I think you'd feel,Little Women
514,happier than if I was left behind.  I don't intend to gad about with,Little Women
514,"you, but leave you free to go where you like, while I amuse myself in",Little Women

514,"Being an energetic individual, Mr. Laurence struck while the iron was",Little Women
514,"hot, and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel,",Little Women
514,"they were off.  During the time necessary for preparation, Laurie bore",Little Women
514,"himself as young gentleman usually do in such cases.  He was moody,",Little Women
514,"irritable, and pensive by turns, lost his appetite, neglected his dress",Little Women
514,"and devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano, avoided",Little Women
514,"Jo, but consoled himself by staring at her from his window, with a",Little Women
514,tragic face that haunted her dreams by night and oppressed her with a,Little Women
514,"heavy sense of guilt by day.  Unlike some sufferers, he never spoke of",Little Women
514,"his unrequited passion, and would allow no one, not even Mrs. March, to",Little Women
514,"attempt consolation or offer sympathy.  On some accounts, this was a",Little Women
514,"relief to his friends, but the weeks before his departure were very",Little Women
514,"uncomfortable, and everyone rejoiced that the 'poor, dear fellow was",Little Women
514,"going away to forget his trouble, and come home happy'.  Of course, he",Little Women
514,"smiled darkly at their delusion, but passed it by with the sad",Little Women
514,superiority of one who knew that his fidelity like his love was,Little Women
514,unalterable.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"When the parting came he affected high spirits, to conceal certain",Little Women
514,inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves.  This,Little Women

514,"for his sake, and he got on very well till Mrs. March kissed him, with",Little Women
514,a whisper full of motherly solicitude.  Then feeling that he was going,Little Women
514,"very fast, he hastily embraced them all round, not forgetting the",Little Women
514,"afflicted Hannah, and ran downstairs as if for his life.  Jo followed a",Little Women
514,minute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round.  He did look,Little Women
514,"round, came back, put his arms about her as she stood on the step above",Little Women
514,"him, and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal",Little Women
514,eloquent and pathetic.,Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Teddy, dear, I wish I could!""",Little Women

514,"That was all, except a little pause.  Then Laurie straightened himself",Little Women
514,"up, said, ""It's all right, never mind,"" and went away without another",Little Women

514,BETH'S SECRET,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"When Jo came home that spring, she had been struck with the change in",Little Women
514,"Beth.  No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it, for it had come too",Little Women
514,"gradually to startle those who saw her daily, but to eyes sharpened by",Little Women
514,"absence, it was very plain and a heavy weight fell on Jo's heart as she",Little Women
514,saw her sister's face. It was no paler and but littler thinner than in,Little Women
514,"the autumn, yet there was a strange, transparent look about it, as if",Little Women
514,"the mortal was being slowly refined away, and the immortal shining",Little Women
514,through the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty.  Jo saw,Little Women
514,"and felt it, but said nothing at the time, and soon the first",Little Women
514,"impression lost much of its power, for Beth seemed happy, no one",Little Women
514,"appeared to doubt that she was better, and presently in other cares Jo",Little Women
514,for a time forgot her fear.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"But when Laurie was gone, and peace prevailed again, the vague anxiety",Little Women
514,returned and haunted her.  She had confessed her sins and been,Little Women
514,"forgiven, but when she showed her savings and proposed a mountain trip,",Little Women
514,"Beth had thanked her heartily, but begged not to go so far away from",Little Women
514,"home.  Another little visit to the seashore would suit her better, and",Little Women
514,"as Grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies, Jo took",Little Women
514,"Beth down to the quiet place, where she could live much in the open",Little Women
514,"air, and let the fresh sea breezes blow a little color into her pale",Little Women
514,cheeks.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It was not a fashionable place, but even among the pleasant people",Little Women
514,"there, the girls made few friends, preferring to live for one another.",Little Women
514,"Beth was too shy to enjoy society, and Jo too wrapped up in her to care",Little Women
514,"for anyone else.  So they were all in all to each other, and came and",Little Women
514,"went, quite unconscious of the interest they excited in those about",Little Women
514,"them, who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the",Little Women
514,"feeble one, always together, as if they felt instinctively that a long",Little Women
514,separation was not far away.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"They did feel it, yet neither spoke of it, for often between ourselves",Little Women
514,and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve which it is,Little Women
514,very hard to overcome.  Jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her,Little Women
514,"heart and Beth's, but when she put out her hand to lift it up, there",Little Women
514,"seemed something sacred in the silence, and she waited for Beth to",Little Women
514,"speak.  She wondered, and was thankful also, that her parents did not",Little Women
514,"seem to see what she saw, and during the quiet weeks when the shadows",Little Women
514,"grew so plain to her, she said nothing of it to those at home,",Little Women
514,believing that it would tell itself when Beth came back no better. She,Little Women
514,"wondered still more if her sister really guessed the hard truth, and",Little Women
514,what thoughts were passing through her mind during the long hours when,Little Women
514,"she lay on the warm rocks with her head in Jo's lap, while the winds",Little Women
514,blew healthfully over her and the sea made music at her feet.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"One day Beth told her.  Jo thought she was asleep, she lay so still,",Little Women
514,"and putting down her book, sat looking at her with wistful eyes, trying",Little Women
514,to see signs of hope in the faint color on Beth's cheeks.  But she,Little Women
514,"could not find enough to satisfy her, for the cheeks were very thin,",Little Women
514,and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells,Little Women
514,they had been collecting. It came to her then more bitterly than ever,Little Women
514,"that Beth was slowly drifting away from her, and her arms instinctively",Little Women
514,tightened their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed. For a,Little Women
514,"minute her eyes were too dim for seeing, and when they cleared, Beth",Little Women
514,was looking up at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for,Little Women
514,"her to say, ""Jo, dear, I'm glad you know it.  I've tried to tell you,",Little Women
514,"but I couldn't.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"There was no answer except her sister's cheek against her own, not even",Little Women
514,"tears, for when most deeply moved, Jo did not cry.  She was the weaker",Little Women
514,"then, and Beth tried to comfort and sustain her, with her arms about",Little Women
514,her and the soothing words she whispered in her ear.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I've known it for a good while, dear, and now I'm used to it, it isn't",Little Women
514,hard to think of or to bear.  Try to see it so and don't be troubled,Little Women
514,"about me, because it's best, indeed it is.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn, Beth? You did not feel",Little Women
514,"it then, and keep it to yourself so long, did you?"" asked Jo, refusing",Little Women
514,"to see or say that it was best, but glad to know that Laurie had no",Little Women
514,part in Beth's trouble.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, I gave up hoping then, but I didn't like to own it. I tried to",Little Women
514,"think it was a sick fancy, and would not let it trouble anyone.  But",Little Women
514,"when I saw you all so well and strong and full of happy plans, it was",Little Women
514,"hard to feel that I could never be like you, and then I was miserable,",Little Women
514,"Jo.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, Beth, and you didn't tell me, didn't let me comfort and help you?",Little Women
514,"How could you shut me out, bear it all alone?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo's voice was full of tender reproach, and her heart ached to think of",Little Women
514,the solitary struggle that must have gone on while Beth learned to say,Little Women
514,"goodbye to health, love, and life, and take up her cross so cheerfully.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Perhaps it was wrong, but I tried to do right.  I wasn't sure, no one",Little Women

514,"and you so happy with Laurie--at least I thought so then.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""And I thought you loved him, Beth, and I went away because I",Little Women
514,"couldn't,"" cried Jo, glad to say all the truth.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Beth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite of her pain,",Little Women
514,"and added softly, ""Then you didn't, dearie? I was afraid it was so, and",Little Women
514,"imagined your poor little heart full of lovelornity all that while.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Why, Jo, how could I, when he was so fond of you?"" asked Beth, as",Little Women
514,"innocently as a child.  ""I do love him dearly.  He is so good to me,",Little Women
514,how can I help It?  But he could never be anything to me but my,Little Women
514,"brother.  I hope he truly will be, sometime.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not through me,"" said Jo decidedly.  ""Amy is left for him, and they",Little Women
514,"would suit excellently, but I have no heart for such things, now.  I",Little Women
514,"don't care what becomes of anybody but you, Beth. You must get well.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I want to, oh, so much!  I try, but every day I lose a little, and",Little Women
514,"feel more sure that I shall never gain it back.  It's like the tide,",Little Women
514,"Jo, when it turns, it goes slowly, but it can't be stopped.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It shall be stopped, your tide must not turn so soon, nineteen is too",Little Women
514,"young, Beth.  I can't let you go.  I'll work and pray and fight against",Little Women
514,"it.  I'll keep you in spite of everything.  There must be ways, it",Little Women
514,"can't be too late.  God won't be so cruel as to take you from me,""",Little Women
514,"cried poor Jo rebelliously, for her spirit was far less piously",Little Women
514,submissive than Beth's.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Simple, sincere people seldom speak much of their piety.  It shows",Little Women
514,"itself in acts rather than in words, and has more influence than",Little Women
514,homilies or protestations.  Beth could not reason upon or explain the,Little Women
514,"faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life, and",Little Women
514,"cheerfully wait for death.  Like a confiding child, she asked no",Little Women
514,"questions, but left everything to God and nature, Father and Mother of",Little Women
514,"us all, feeling sure that they, and they only, could teach and",Little Women
514,strengthen heart and spirit for this life and the life to come.  She,Little Women
514,"did not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches, only loved her better for her",Little Women
514,"passionate affection, and clung more closely to the dear human love,",Little Women
514,"from which our Father never means us to be weaned, but through which He",Little Women
514,"draws us closer to Himself.  She could not say, ""I'm glad to go,"" for",Little Women
514,"life was very sweet for her.  She could only sob out, ""I try to be",Little Women
514,"willing,"" while she held fast to Jo, as the first bitter wave of this",Little Women
514,great sorrow broke over them together.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"By and by Beth said, with recovered serenity, ""You'll tell them this",Little Women
514,"when we go home?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I think they will see it without words,"" sighed Jo, for now it seemed",Little Women
514,to her that Beth changed every day.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Perhaps not.  I've heard that the people who love best are often",Little Women
514,"blindest to such things.  If they don't see it, you will tell them for",Little Women
514,"me.  I don't want any secrets, and it's kinder to prepare them.  Meg",Little Women
514,"has John and the babies to comfort her, but you must stand by Father",Little Women
514,"and Mother, won't you Jo?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""If I can.  But, Beth, I don't give up yet.  I'm going to believe that",Little Women
514,"it is a sick fancy, and not let you think it's true."" said Jo, trying",Little Women
514,to speak cheerfully.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Beth lay a minute thinking, and then said in her quiet way, ""I don't",Little Women
514,"know how to express myself, and shouldn't try to anyone but you,",Little Women
514,because I can't speak out except to my Jo.  I only mean to say that I,Little Women
514,have a feeling that it never was intended I should live long.  I'm not,Little Women
514,like the rest of you.  I never made any plans about what I'd do when I,Little Women
514,"grew up.  I never thought of being married, as you all did.  I couldn't",Little Women
514,"seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little Beth, trotting about",Little Women
514,"at home, of no use anywhere but there.  I never wanted to go away, and",Little Women
514,"the hard part now is the leaving you all.  I'm not afraid, but it seems",Little Women
514,"as if I should be homesick for you even in heaven.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo could not speak, and for several minutes there was no sound but the",Little Women
514,sigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide.  A white-winged gull flew,Little Women
514,"by, with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast.  Beth watched it",Little Women
514,"till it vanished, and her eyes were full of sadness.  A little",Little Women
514,gray-coated sand bird came tripping over the beach 'peeping' softly to,Little Women
514,"itself, as if enjoying the sun and sea.  It came quite close to Beth,",Little Women
514,"and looked at her with a friendly eye and sat upon a warm stone,",Little Women
514,"dressing its wet feathers, quite at home.  Beth smiled and felt",Little Women
514,"comforted, for the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship and",Little Women
514,remind her that a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Dear little bird!  See, Jo, how tame it is.  I like peeps better than",Little Women
514,"the gulls.  They are not so wild and handsome, but they seem happy,",Little Women

514,"Mother said they reminded her of me--busy, quaker-colored creatures,",Little Women
514,"always near the shore, and always chirping that contented little song",Little Women
514,"of theirs.  You are the gull, Jo, strong and wild, fond of the storm",Little Women
514,"and the wind, flying far out to sea, and happy all alone.  Meg is the",Little Women
514,"turtledove, and Amy is like the lark she writes about, trying to get up",Little Women
514,"among the clouds, but always dropping down into its nest again.  Dear",Little Women
514,"little girl!  She's so ambitious, but her heart is good and tender, and",Little Women
514,"no matter how high she flies, she never will forget home.  I hope I",Little Women

514,,Little Women

514,would be spared the hard task of telling Beth's secret.  Her father,Little Women

514,"Many nations are represented, many languages spoken, many costumes",Little Women
514,"worn, and on a sunny day the spectacle is as gay and brilliant as a",Little Women

514,"drive, sit, or saunter here, chatting over the news, and criticizing",Little Women
514,"the latest celebrity who has arrived--Ristori or Dickens, Victor",Little Women
514,Emmanuel or the Queen of the Sandwich Islands.  The equipages are as,Little Women
514,"varied as the company and attract as much attention, especially the low",Little Women
514,"basket barouches in which ladies drive themselves, with a pair of",Little Women
514,"dashing ponies, gay nets to keep their voluminous flounces from",Little Women
514,"overflowing the diminutive vehicles, and little grooms on the perch",Little Women
514,behind.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Along this walk, on Christmas Day, a tall young man walked slowly, with",Little Women
514,"his hands behind him, and a somewhat absent expression of countenance.",Little Women
514,"He looked like an Italian, was dressed like an Englishman, and had the",Little Women
514,independent air of an American--a combination which caused sundry pairs,Little Women
514,"of feminine eyes to look approvingly after him, and sundry dandies in",Little Women
514,"black velvet suits, with rose-colored neckties, buff gloves, and orange",Little Women
514,"flowers in their buttonholes, to shrug their shoulders, and then envy",Little Women
514,"him his inches. There were plenty of pretty faces to admire, but the",Little Women
514,"young man took little notice of them, except to glance now and then at",Little Women
514,some blonde girl in blue.  Presently he strolled out of the promenade,Little Women
514,"and stood a moment at the crossing, as if undecided whether to go and",Little Women
514,"listen to the band in the Jardin Publique, or to wander along the beach",Little Women
514,"toward Castle Hill.  The quick trot of ponies' feet made him look up,",Little Women
514,"as one of the little carriages, containing a single young lady, came",Little Women
514,"rapidly down the street.  The lady was young, blonde, and dressed in",Little Women

514,"her.  He was handsomer than ever and greatly improved, she thought, but",Little Women
514,"now that the flush of pleasure at meeting her was over, he looked tired",Little Women
514,"and spiritless--not sick, nor exactly unhappy, but older and graver",Little Women
514,than a year or two of prosperous life should have made him.  She,Little Women
514,"couldn't understand it and did not venture to ask questions, so she",Little Women
514,"shook her head and touched up her ponies, as the procession wound away",Little Women
514,across the arches of the Paglioni bridge and vanished in the church.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Que pensez-vous?"" she said, airing her French, which had improved in",Little Women
514,"quantity, if not in quality, since she came abroad.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That mademoiselle has made good use of her time, and the result is",Little Women
514,"charming,"" replied Laurie, bowing with his hand on his heart and an",Little Women
514,admiring look.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She blushed with pleasure, but somehow the compliment did not satisfy",Little Women
514,"her like the blunt praises he used to give her at home, when he",Little Women
514,"promenaded round her on festival occasions, and told her she was",Little Women
514,"'altogether jolly', with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the",Little Women
514,"head.  She didn't like the new tone, for though not blase, it sounded",Little Women
514,indifferent in spite of the look.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""If that's the way he's going to grow up, I wish he'd stay a boy,"" she",Little Women
514,"thought, with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort, trying",Little Women
514,meantime to seem quite easy and gay.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"At Avigdor's she found the precious home letters and, giving the reins",Little Women
514,"to Laurie, read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road",Little Women
514,"between green hedges, where tea roses bloomed as freshly as in June.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Beth is very poorly, Mother says.  I often think I ought to go home,",Little Women
514,"but they all say 'stay'.  So I do, for I shall never have another",Little Women
514,"chance like this,"" said Amy, looking sober over one page.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I think you are right, there.  You could do nothing at home, and it is",Little Women
514,"a great comfort to them to know that you are well and happy, and",Little Women
514,"enjoying so much, my dear.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He drew a little nearer, and looked more like his old self as he said",Little Women
514,"that, and the fear that sometimes weighed on Amy's heart was lightened,",Little Women
514,"for the look, the act, the brotherly 'my dear', seemed to assure her",Little Women
514,"that if any trouble did come, she would not be alone in a strange land.",Little Women
514,Presently she laughed and showed him a small sketch of Jo in her,Little Women
514,"scribbling suit, with the bow rampantly erect upon her cap, and issuing",Little Women
514,"from her mouth the words, 'Genius burns!'.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie smiled, took it, put it in his vest pocket 'to keep it from",Little Women
514,"blowing away', and listened with interest to the lively letter Amy read",Little Women
514,him.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""This will be a regularly merry Christmas to me, with presents in the",Little Women
514,"morning, you and letters in the afternoon, and a party at night,"" said",Little Women
514,"Amy, as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort, and a flock of",Little Women
514,"splendid peacocks came trooping about them, tamely waiting to be fed.",Little Women
514,While Amy stood laughing on the bank above him as she scattered crumbs,Little Women
514,"to the brilliant birds, Laurie looked at her as she had looked at him,",Little Women
514,with a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had,Little Women
514,"wrought.  He found nothing to perplex or disappoint, much to admire and",Little Women
514,"approve, for overlooking a few little affectations of speech and",Little Women
514,"manner, she was as sprightly and graceful as ever, with the addition of",Little Women
514,that indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call,Little Women
514,"elegance.  Always mature for her age, she had gained a certain aplomb",Little Women
514,"in both carriage and conversation, which made her seem more of a woman",Little Women
514,"of the world than she was, but her old petulance now and then showed",Little Women
514,"itself, her strong will still held its own, and her native frankness",Little Women
514,was unspoiled by foreign polish.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks,",Little Women
514,"but he saw enough to satisfy and interest him, and carried away a",Little Women
514,"pretty little picture of a bright-faced girl standing in the sunshine,",Little Women
514,"which brought out the soft hue of her dress, the fresh collar of her",Little Women
514,"cheeks, the golden gloss of her hair, and made her a prominent figure",Little Women
514,in the pleasant scene.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As they came up onto the stone plateau that crowns the hill, Amy waved",Little Women
514,"her hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt, and said, pointing",Little Women
514,"here and there, ""Do you remember the Cathedral and the Corso, the",Little Women
514,"fishermen dragging their nets in the bay, and the lovely road to Villa",Little Women
514,"Franca, Schubert's Tower, just below, and best of all, that speck far",Little Women
514,"out to sea which they say is Corsica?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I remember.  It's not much changed,"" he answered without enthusiasm.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What Jo would give for a sight of that famous speck!"" said Amy,",Little Women
514,feeling in good spirits and anxious to see him so also.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes,"" was all he said, but he turned and strained his eyes to see the",Little Women
514,island which a greater usurper than even Napoleon now made interesting,Little Women
514,in his sight.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Take a good look at it for her sake, and then come and tell me what",Little Women
514,"you have been doing with yourself all this while,"" said Amy, seating",Little Women
514,"herself, ready for a good talk.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"But she did not get it, for though he joined her and answered all her",Little Women
514,"questions freely, she could only learn that he had roved about the",Little Women
514,"Continent and been to Greece.  So after idling away an hour, they drove",Little Women
514,"home again, and having paid his respects to Mrs. Carrol, Laurie left",Little Women
514,"them, promising to return in the evening.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,It must be recorded of Amy that she deliberately prinked that night.,Little Women
514,Time and absence had done its work on both the young people. She had,Little Women
514,"seen her old friend in a new light, not as 'our boy', but as a handsome",Little Women
514,"and agreeable man, and she was conscious of a very natural desire to",Little Women
514,"find favor in his sight.  Amy knew her good points, and made the most",Little Women
514,of them with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and,Little Women
514,pretty woman.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Tarlatan and tulle were cheap at Nice, so she enveloped herself in them",Little Women
514,"on such occasions, and following the sensible English fashion of simple",Little Women
514,"dress for young girls, got up charming little toilettes with fresh",Little Women
514,"flowers, a few trinkets, and all manner of dainty devices, which were",Little Women
514,both inexpensive and effective.  It must be confessed that the artist,Little Women
514,"sometimes got possession of the woman, and indulged in antique",Little Women
514,"coiffures, statuesque attitudes, and classic draperies. But, dear",Little Women
514,"heart, we all have our little weaknesses, and find it easy to pardon",Little Women
514,"such in the young, who satisfy our eyes with their comeliness, and keep",Little Women
514,our hearts merry with their artless vanities.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I do want him to think I look well, and tell them so at home,"" said",Little Women
514,"Amy to herself, as she put on Flo's old white silk ball dress, and",Little Women
514,"covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion, out of which her white",Little Women
514,shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect. Her hair,Little Women
514,"she had the sense to let alone, after gathering up the thick waves and",Little Women
514,curls into a Hebe-like knot at the back of her head.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's not the fashion, but it's becoming, and I can't afford to make a",Little Women
514,"fright of myself,"" she used to say, when advised to frizzle, puff, or",Little Women
514,"braid, as the latest style commanded.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion, Amy looped",Little Women
514,"her fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea, and framed the white",Little Women
514,"shoulders in delicate green vines.  Remembering the painted boots, she",Little Women
514,"surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction, and",Little Women
514,"chasseed down the room, admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""My new fan just matches my flowers, my gloves fit to a charm, and the",Little Women
514,real lace on Aunt's mouchoir gives an air to my whole dress. If I only,Little Women
514,"had a classical nose and mouth I should be perfectly happy,"" she said,",Little Women
514,surveying herself with a critical eye and a candle in each hand.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"In spite of this affliction, she looked unusually gay and graceful as",Little Women
514,"she glided away.  She seldom ran--it did not suit her style, she",Little Women
514,"thought, for being tall, the stately and Junoesque was more appropriate",Little Women
514,than the sportive or piquante.  She walked up and down the long saloon,Little Women
514,"while waiting for Laurie, and once arranged herself under the",Little Women
514,"chandelier, which had a good effect upon her hair, then she thought",Little Women
514,"better of it, and went away to the other end of the room, as if ashamed",Little Women
514,of the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one.  It so,Little Women
514,"happened that she could not have done a better thing, for Laurie came",Little Women
514,"in so quietly she did not hear him, and as she stood at the distant",Little Women
514,"window, with her head half turned and one hand gathering up her dress,",Little Women
514,"the slender, white figure against the red curtains was as effective as",Little Women
514,a well-placed statue.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Good evening, Diana!"" said Laurie, with the look of satisfaction she",Little Women
514,liked to see in his eyes when they rested on her.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Good evening, Apollo!"" she answered, smiling back at him, for he too",Little Women
514,"looked unusually debonair, and the thought of entering the ballroom on",Little Women
514,the arm of such a personable man caused Amy to pity the four plain,Little Women
514,Misses Davis from the bottom of her heart.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Here are your flowers.  I arranged them myself, remembering that you",Little Women
514,"didn't like what Hannah calls a 'sot-bookay',"" said Laurie, handing her",Little Women
514,"a delicate nosegay, in a holder that she had long coveted as she daily",Little Women
514,passed it in Cardiglia's window.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How kind you are!"" she exclaimed gratefully.  ""If I'd known you were",Little Women
514,"coming I'd have had something ready for you today, though not as pretty",Little Women
514,"as this, I'm afraid.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Thank you.  It isn't what it should be, but you have improved it,"" he",Little Women
514,"added, as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Please don't.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I thought you liked that sort of thing.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not from you, it doesn't sound natural, and I like your old bluntness",Little Women
514,"better.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm glad of it,"" he answered, with a look of relief, then buttoned her",Little Women
514,"gloves for her, and asked if his tie was straight, just as he used to",Little Women
514,do when they went to parties together at home.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The company assembled in the long salle a manger, that evening, was",Little Women
514,such as one sees nowhere but on the Continent.  The hospitable,Little Women
514,"Americans had invited every acquaintance they had in Nice, and having",Little Women
514,"no prejudice against titles, secured a few to add luster to their",Little Women
514,Christmas ball.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,A Russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and talk,Little Women
514,"with a massive lady, dressed like Hamlet's mother in black velvet with",Little Women
514,"a pearl bridle under her chin.  A Polish count, aged eighteen, devoted",Little Women
514,"himself to the ladies, who pronounced him, 'a fascinating dear', and a",Little Women
514,"German Serene Something, having come to supper alone, roamed vaguely",Little Women
514,"about, seeking what he might devour.  Baron Rothschild's private",Little Women
514,"secretary, a large-nosed Jew in tight boots, affably beamed upon the",Little Women
514,"world, as if his master's name crowned him with a golden halo.  A stout",Little Women
514,"Frenchman, who knew the Emperor, came to indulge his mania for dancing,",Little Women
514,"and Lady de Jones, a British matron, adorned the scene with her little",Little Women
514,"family of eight.  Of course, there were many light-footed,",Little Women
514,"shrill-voiced American girls, handsome, lifeless-looking English ditto,",Little Women
514,"and a few plain but piquante French demoiselles, likewise the usual set",Little Women
514,"of traveling young gentlemen who disported themselves gaily, while",Little Women
514,mammas of all nations lined the walls and smiled upon them benignly,Little Women
514,when they danced with their daughters.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Any young girl can imagine Amy's state of mind when she 'took the,Little Women
514,"stage' that night, leaning on Laurie's arm.  She knew she looked well,",Little Women
514,"she loved to dance, she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a",Little Women
514,"ballroom, and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when",Little Women
514,young girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to,Little Women
514,"rule by virtue of beauty, youth, and womanhood.  She did pity the Davis",Little Women
514,"girls, who were awkward, plain, and destitute of escort, except a grim",Little Women
514,"papa and three grimmer maiden aunts, and she bowed to them in her",Little Women
514,"friendliest manner as she passed, which was good of her, as it",Little Women
514,"permitted them to see her dress, and burn with curiosity to know who",Little Women
514,her distinguished-looking friend might be.  With the first burst of the,Little Women
514,"band, Amy's color rose, her eyes began to sparkle, and her feet to tap",Little Women
514,"the floor impatiently, for she danced well and wanted Laurie to know",Little Women
514,it.  Therefore the shock she received can better be imagined than,Little Women
514,"described, when he said in a perfectly tranquil tone, ""Do you care to",Little Women
514,"dance?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""One usually does at a ball.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Her amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to repair his error as,Little Women
514,fast as possible.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I meant the first dance.  May I have the honor?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I can give you one if I put off the Count.  He dances divinely, but he",Little Women
514,"will excuse me, as you are an old friend,"" said Amy, hoping that the",Little Women
514,"name would have a good effect, and show Laurie that she was not to be",Little Women
514,trifled with.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Nice little boy, but rather a short Pole to support...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"    A daughter of the gods,",Little Women
514,"    Divinely tall, and most divinely fair,""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"was all the satisfaction she got, however.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The set in which they found themselves was composed of English, and Amy",Little Women
514,"was compelled to walk decorously through a cotillion, feeling all the",Little Women
514,while as if she could dance the tarantella with relish.  Laurie,Little Women
514,"resigned her to the 'nice little boy', and went to do his duty to Flo,",Little Women
514,"without securing Amy for the joys to come, which reprehensible want of",Little Women
514,"forethought was properly punished, for she immediately engaged herself",Little Women
514,"till supper, meaning to relent if he then gave any signs penitence. She",Little Women
514,showed him her ball book with demure satisfaction when he strolled,Little Women
514,"instead of rushed up to claim her for the next, a glorious polka",Little Women
514,"redowa.  But his polite regrets didn't impose upon her, and when she",Little Women
514,"galloped away with the Count, she saw Laurie sit down by her aunt with",Little Women
514,an actual expression of relief.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"That was unpardonable, and Amy took no more notice of him for a long",Little Women
514,"while, except a word now and then when she came to her chaperon between",Little Women
514,the dances for a necessary pin or a moment's rest.  Her anger had a,Little Women
514,"good effect, however, for she hid it under a smiling face, and seemed",Little Women
514,unusually blithe and brilliant.  Laurie's eyes followed her with,Little Women
514,"pleasure, for she neither romped nor sauntered, but danced with spirit",Little Women
514,"and grace, making the delightsome pastime what it should be.  He very",Little Women
514,"naturally fell to studying her from this new point of view, and before",Little Women
514,"the evening was half over, had decided that 'little Amy was going to",Little Women
514,make a very charming woman'.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It was a lively scene, for soon the spirit of the social season took",Little Women
514,"possession of everyone, and Christmas merriment made all faces shine,",Little Women
514,"hearts happy, and heels light.  The musicians fiddled, tooted, and",Little Women
514,"banged as if they enjoyed it, everybody danced who could, and those who",Little Women
514,couldn't admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth.  The air was,Little Women
514,"dark with Davises, and many Joneses gamboled like a flock of young",Little Women
514,giraffes.  The golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor,Little Women
514,with a dashing French-woman who carpeted the floor with her pink satin,Little Women
514,"train.  The serene Teuton found the supper-table and was happy, eating",Little Women
514,"steadily through the bill of fare, and dismayed the garcons by the",Little Women
514,ravages he committed.  But the Emperor's friend covered himself with,Little Women
514,"glory, for he danced everything, whether he knew it or not, and",Little Women
514,introduced impromptu pirouettes when the figures bewildered him.  The,Little Women
514,"boyish abandon of that stout man was charming to behold, for though he",Little Women
514,"'carried weight', he danced like an India-rubber ball.  He ran, he",Little Women
514,"flew, he pranced, his face glowed, his bald head shown, his coattails",Little Women
514,"waved wildly, his pumps actually twinkled in the air, and when the",Little Women
514,"music stopped, he wiped the drops from his brow, and beamed upon his",Little Women
514,fellow men like a French Pickwick without glasses.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Amy and her Pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm but more,Little Women
514,"graceful agility, and Laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time",Little Women
514,to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as,Little Women
514,indefatigably as if winged. When little Vladimir finally relinquished,Little Women
514,"her, with assurances that he was 'desolated to leave so early', she was",Little Women
514,"ready to rest, and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It had been successful, for at three-and-twenty, blighted affections",Little Women
514,"find a balm in friendly society, and young nerves will thrill, young",Little Women
514,"blood dance, and healthy young spirits rise, when subjected to the",Little Women
514,"enchantment of beauty, light, music, and motion.  Laurie had a waked-up",Little Women
514,"look as he rose to give her his seat, and when he hurried away to bring",Little Women
514,"her some supper, she said to herself, with a satisfied smile, ""Ah, I",Little Women
514,"thought that would do him good!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You look like Balzac's '_Femme Peinte Par Elle-Meme_',"" he said, as he",Little Women
514,fanned her with one hand and held her coffee cup in the other.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""My rouge won't come off."" and Amy rubbed her brilliant cheek, and",Little Women
514,showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh,Little Women
514,outright.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What do you call this stuff?"" he asked, touching a fold of her dress",Little Women

514,"""Where did you learn all this sort of thing?"" he asked with a quizzical",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""As 'this sort of thing' is rather a vague expression, would you kindly",Little Women
514,"explain?"" returned Amy, knowing perfectly well what he meant, but",Little Women
514,wickedly leaving him to describe what is indescribable.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well--the general air, the style, the self-possession,",Little Women

514,"opportunity, and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers.",Little Women
514,"Amy did not know why he looked at her so kindly, nor why he filled up",Little Women

514,"As she was a womanly little woman, the maternal instinct was very",Little Women
514,"strong, and she was entirely absorbed in her children, to the utter",Little Women
514,exclusion of everything and everybody else.  Day and night she brooded,Little Women
514,"over them with tireless devotion and anxiety, leaving John to the",Little Women
514,"tender mercies of the help, for an Irish lady now presided over the",Little Women
514,"kitchen department.  Being a domestic man, John decidedly missed the",Little Women
514,"wifely attentions he had been accustomed to receive, but as he adored",Little Women
514,"his babies, he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time,",Little Women
514,supposing with masculine ignorance that peace would soon be restored.,Little Women
514,"But three months passed, and there was no return of repose.  Meg looked",Little Women
514,"worn and nervous, the babies absorbed every minute of her time, the",Little Women
514,"house was neglected, and Kitty, the cook, who took life 'aisy', kept",Little Women
514,him on short commons.  When he went out in the morning he was,Little Women
514,"bewildered by small commissions for the captive mamma, if he came gaily",Little Women
514,"in at night, eager to embrace his family, he was quenched by a ""Hush!",Little Women
514,"They are just asleep after worrying all day.""  If he proposed a little",Little Women
514,"amusement at home, ""No, it would disturb the babies.""  If he hinted at",Little Women
514,"a lecture or a concert, he was answered with a reproachful look, and a",Little Women
514,"decided--""Leave my children for pleasure, never!""  His sleep was broken",Little Women
514,by infant wails and visions of a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to,Little Women
514,and fro in the watches of the night.  His meals were interrupted by the,Little Women
514,"frequent flight of the presiding genius, who deserted him, half-helped,",Little Women
514,if a muffled chirp sounded from the nest above.  And when he read his,Little Women
514,"paper of an evening, Demi's colic got into the shipping list and",Little Women
514,"Daisy's fall affected the price of stocks, for Mrs. Brooke was only",Little Women
514,interested in domestic news.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The poor man was very uncomfortable, for the children had bereft him of",Little Women
514,"his wife, home was merely a nursery and the perpetual 'hushing' made",Little Women
514,him feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered the sacred,Little Women
514,"precincts of Babyland.  He bore it very patiently for six months, and",Little Women
514,"when no signs of amendment appeared, he did what other paternal exiles",Little Women
514,do--tried to get a little comfort elsewhere.  Scott had married and,Little Women
514,"gone to housekeeping not far off, and John fell into the way of running",Little Women
514,"over for an hour or two of an evening, when his own parlor was empty,",Little Women
514,and his own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end.  Mrs.,Little Women
514,"Scott was a lively, pretty girl, with nothing to do but be agreeable,",Little Women
514,and she performed her mission most successfully.  The parlor was always,Little Women
514,"bright and attractive, the chessboard ready, the piano in tune, plenty",Little Women
514,"of gay gossip, and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,John would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so,Little Women
514,"lonely, but as it was he gratefully took the next best thing and",Little Women
514,enjoyed his neighbor's society.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg rather approved of the new arrangement at first, and found it a",Little Women
514,relief to know that John was having a good time instead of dozing in,Little Women
514,"the parlor, or tramping about the house and waking the children.  But",Little Women
514,"by-and-by, when the teething worry was over and the idols went to sleep",Little Women
514,"at proper hours, leaving Mamma time to rest, she began to miss John,",Little Women
514,"and find her workbasket dull company, when he was not sitting opposite",Little Women
514,"in his old dressing gown, comfortably scorching his slippers on the",Little Women
514,"fender.  She would not ask him to stay at home, but felt injured",Little Women
514,"because he did not know that she wanted him without being told,",Little Women
514,entirely forgetting the many evenings he had waited for her in vain.,Little Women
514,"She was nervous and worn out with watching and worry, and in that",Little Women
514,unreasonable frame of mind which the best of mothers occasionally,Little Women
514,experience when domestic cares oppress them.  Want of exercise robs,Little Women
514,"them of cheerfulness, and too much devotion to that idol of American",Little Women
514,"women, the teapot, makes them feel as if they were all nerve and no",Little Women
514,muscle.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes,"" she would say, looking in the glass, ""I'm getting old and ugly.",Little Women

514,"Well, the babies love me, they don't care if I am thin and pale and",Little Women

514,"will see what I've gladly sacrificed for them, won't he, my precious?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"To which pathetic appeal Daisy would answer with a coo, or Demi with a",Little Women
514,"crow, and Meg would put by her lamentations for a maternal revel, which",Little Women
514,soothed her solitude for the time being. But the pain increased as,Little Women
514,"politics absorbed John, who was always running over to discuss",Little Women
514,"interesting points with Scott, quite unconscious that Meg missed him.",Little Women
514,"Not a word did she say, however, till her mother found her in tears one",Little Women

514,they found out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they,Little Women

514,"so easily subjugated, and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by",Little Women
514,an attempt at paternal discipline with his obstreperous son. For Demi,Little Women

514,"anything, all the king's horses and all the king's men could not change",Little Women
514,that pertinacious little mind.  Mamma thought the dear too young to be,Little Women
514,"taught to conquer his prejudices, but Papa believed that it never was",Little Women
514,too soon to learn obedience.  So Master Demi early discovered that when,Little Women
514,"he undertook to 'wrastle' with 'Parpar', he always got the worst of it,",Little Women

514,that nothing should interfere with her experiment.  But unfortunately,Little Women
514,"Demi's most unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed, and that",Little Women

514,"of the bed, whither he had wriggled in his anguish of mind.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Poor little man, he's worn out with sleep and crying.  I'll cover him",Little Women
514,"up, and then go and set Meg's heart at rest,"" thought John, creeping to",Little Women
514,"the bedside, hoping to find his rebellious heir asleep.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"But he wasn't, for the moment his father peeped at him, Demi's eyes",Little Women
514,"opened, his little chin began to quiver, and he put up his arms, saying",Little Women
514,"with a penitent hiccough, ""Me's dood, now.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Sitting on the stairs outside Meg wondered at the long silence which,Little Women
514,"followed the uproar, and after imagining all sorts of impossible",Little Women
514,"accidents, she slipped into the room to set her fears at rest.  Demi",Little Women
514,"lay fast asleep, not in his usual spreadeagle attitude, but in a",Little Women
514,"subdued bunch, cuddled close in the circle of his father's arm and",Little Women
514,"holding his father's finger, as if he felt that justice was tempered",Little Women
514,"with mercy, and had gone to sleep a sadder and wiser baby.  So held,",Little Women
514,John had waited with a womanly patience till the little hand relaxed,Little Women
514,"its hold, and while waiting had fallen asleep, more tired by that",Little Women
514,tussle with his son than with his whole day's work.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow, she smiled to",Little Women
514,"herself, and then slipped away again, saying in a satisfied tone, ""I",Little Women
514,never need fear that John will be too harsh with my babies.  He does,Little Women
514,"know how to manage them, and will be a great help, for Demi is getting",Little Women
514,"too much for me.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"When John came down at last, expecting to find a pensive or reproachful",Little Women
514,"wife, he was agreeably surprised to find Meg placidly trimming a",Little Women
514,"bonnet, and to be greeted with the request to read something about the",Little Women
514,"election, if he was not too tired.  John saw in a minute that a",Little Women
514,"revolution of some kind was going on, but wisely asked no questions,",Little Women
514,"knowing that Meg was such a transparent little person, she couldn't",Little Women
514,"keep a secret to save her life, and therefore the clue would soon",Little Women
514,appear.  He read a long debate with the most amiable readiness and then,Little Women
514,"explained it in his most lucid manner, while Meg tried to look deeply",Little Women
514,"interested, to ask intelligent questions, and keep her thoughts from",Little Women
514,wandering from the state of the nation to the state of her bonnet.  In,Little Women
514,"her secret soul, however, she decided that politics were as bad as",Little Women
514,"mathematics, and that the mission of politicians seemed to be calling",Little Women
514,"each other names, but she kept these feminine ideas to herself, and",Little Women
514,"when John paused, shook her head and said with what she thought",Little Women
514,"diplomatic ambiguity, ""Well, I really don't see what we are coming to.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"John laughed, and watched her for a minute, as she poised a pretty",Little Women
514,"little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand, and regarded it",Little Women
514,with the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""She is trying to like politics for my sake, so I'll try and like",Little Women
514,"millinery for hers, that's only fair,"" thought John the Just, adding",Little Women
514,"aloud, ""That's very pretty.  Is it what you call a breakfast cap?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""My dear man, it's a bonnet!   My very best go-to-concert-and-theater",Little Women
514,"bonnet.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I beg your pardon, it was so small, I naturally mistook it for one of",Little Women
514,"the flyaway things you sometimes wear. How do you keep it on?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""These bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud, so,""",Little Women
514,and Meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet and regarding him with an,Little Women
514,air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's a love of a bonnet, but I prefer the face inside, for it looks",Little Women
514,"young and happy again,"" and John kissed the smiling face, to the great",Little Women
514,detriment of the rosebud under the chin.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm glad you like it, for I want you to take me to one of the new",Little Women
514,concerts some night.  I really need some music to put me in tune.  Will,Little Women
514,"you, please?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Of course I will, with all my heart, or anywhere else you like.  You",Little Women
514,"have been shut up so long, it will do you no end of good, and I shall",Little Women
514,"enjoy it, of all things.  What put it into your head, little mother?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, I had a talk with Marmee the other day, and told her how nervous",Little Women
514,"and cross and out of sorts I felt, and she said I needed change and",Little Women
514,"less care, so Hannah is to help me with the children, and I'm to see to",Little Women
514,"things about the house more, and now and then have a little fun, just",Little Women
514,"to keep me from getting to be a fidgety, broken-down old woman before",Little Women
514,"my time.  It's only an experiment, John, and I want to try it for your",Little Women
514,"sake as much as for mine, because I've neglected you shamefully lately,",Little Women
514,"and I'm going to make home what it used to be, if I can.  You don't",Little Women
514,"object, I hope?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Never mind what John said, or what a very narrow escape the little",Little Women
514,bonnet had from utter ruin.  All that we have any business to know is,Little Women
514,"that John did not appear to object, judging from the changes which",Little Women
514,gradually took place in the house and its inmates.  It was not all,Little Women
514,"Paradise by any means, but everyone was better for the division of",Little Women
514,"labor system.  The children throve under the paternal rule, for",Little Women
514,"accurate, steadfast John brought order and obedience into Babydom, while",Little Women
514,Meg recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty of,Little Women
514,"wholesome exercise, a little pleasure, and much confidential",Little Women
514,"conversation with her sensible husband.  Home grew homelike again, and",Little Women
514,"John had no wish to leave it, unless he took Meg with him.  The Scotts",Little Women
514,"came to the Brookes' now, and everyone found the little house a",Little Women
514,"cheerful place, full of happiness, content, and family love.  Even",Little Women
514,"Sallie Moffatt liked to go there.  ""It is always so quiet and pleasant",Little Women
514,"here, it does me good, Meg,"" she used to say, looking about her with",Little Women
514,"wistful eyes, as if trying to discover the charm, that she might use it",Little Women
514,"in her great house, full of splendid loneliness, for there were no",Little Women
514,"riotous, sunny-faced babies there, and Ned lived in a world of his own,",Little Women
514,where there was no place for her.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"This household happiness did not come all at once, but John and Meg had",Little Women
514,"found the key to it, and each year of married life taught them how to",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,LAZY LAURENCE,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie went to Nice intending to stay a week, and remained a month.  He",Little Women
514,"was tired of wandering about alone, and Amy's familiar presence seemed",Little Women
514,to give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a,Little Women
514,"part.  He rather missed the 'petting' he used to receive, and enjoyed a",Little Women
514,"taste of it again, for no attentions, however flattering, from",Little Women
514,"strangers, were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls",Little Women
514,"at home.  Amy never would pet him like the others, but she was very",Little Women
514,"glad to see him now, and quite clung to him, feeling that he was the",Little Women
514,representative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she,Little Women
514,would confess.  They naturally took comfort in each other's society and,Little Women
514,"were much together, riding, walking, dancing, or dawdling, for at Nice",Little Women
514,"no one can be very industrious during the gay season.  But, while",Little Women
514,"apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion, they were",Little Women
514,half-consciously making discoveries and forming opinions about each,Little Women
514,"other.  Amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend, but he sank in",Little Women
514,"hers, and each felt the truth before a word was spoken.  Amy tried to",Little Women
514,"please, and succeeded, for she was grateful for the many pleasures he",Little Women
514,"gave her, and repaid him with the little services to which womanly",Little Women
514,women know how to lend an indescribable charm.  Laurie made no effort,Little Women
514,"of any kind, but just let himself drift along as comfortably as",Little Women
514,"possible, trying to forget, and feeling that all women owed him a kind",Little Women
514,word because one had been cold to him.  It cost him no effort to be,Little Women
514,"generous, and he would have given Amy all the trinkets in Nice if she",Little Women
514,"would have taken them, but at the same time he felt that he could not",Little Women
514,"change the opinion she was forming of him, and he rather dreaded the",Little Women
514,"keen blue eyes that seemed to watch him with such half-sorrowful,",Little Women
514,half-scornful surprise.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""All the rest have gone to Monaco for the day.  I preferred to stay at",Little Women
514,"home and write letters.  They are done now, and I am going to Valrosa",Little Women
514,"to sketch, will you come?"" said Amy, as she joined Laurie one lovely",Little Women
514,"day when he lounged in as usual, about noon.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, yes, but isn't it rather warm for such a long walk?"" he answered",Little Women
514,"slowly, for the shaded salon looked inviting after the glare without.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm going to have the little carriage, and Baptiste can drive, so",Little Women
514,"you'll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella, and keep your gloves",Little Women
514,"nice,"" returned Amy, with a sarcastic glance at the immaculate kids,",Little Women
514,which were a weak point with Laurie.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Then I'll go with pleasure."" and he put out his hand for her",Little Women
514,sketchbook.  But she tucked it under her arm with a sharp...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't trouble yourself.  It's no exertion to me, but you don't look",Little Women
514,"equal to it.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Laurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran,Little Women
514,"downstairs, but when they got into the carriage he took the reins",Little Women
514,"himself, and left little Baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and",Little Women
514,fall asleep on his perch.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The two never quarreled.  Amy was too well-bred, and just now Laurie",Little Women
514,"was too lazy, so in a minute he peeped under her hatbrim with an",Little Women
514,"inquiring air.  She answered him with a smile, and they went on",Little Women
514,together in the most amicable manner.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It was a lovely drive, along winding roads rich in the picturesque",Little Women
514,"scenes that delight beauty-loving eyes.  Here an ancient monastery,",Little Women
514,whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them.  There a,Little Women
514,"bare-legged shepherd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat, and rough jacket",Little Women
514,"over one shoulder, sat piping on a stone while his goats skipped among",Little Women
514,"the rocks or lay at his feet.  Meek, mouse-colored donkeys, laden with",Little Women
514,"panniers of freshly cut grass passed by, with a pretty girl in a",Little Women
514,"capaline sitting between the green piles, or an old woman spinning with",Little Women
514,"a distaff as she went. Brown, soft-eyed children ran out from the",Little Women
514,"quaint stone hovels to offer nosegays, or bunches of oranges still on",Little Women
514,the bough. Gnarled olive trees covered the hills with their dusky,Little Women
514,"foliage, fruit hung golden in the orchard, and great scarlet anemones",Little Women
514,"fringed the roadside, while beyond green slopes and craggy heights, the",Little Women
514,Maritime Alps rose sharp and white against the blue Italian sky.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Valrosa well deserved its name, for in that climate of perpetual summer",Little Women
514,"roses blossomed everywhere.  They overhung the archway, thrust",Little Women
514,themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to,Little Women
514,"passers-by, and lined the avenue, winding through lemon trees and",Little Women
514,"feathery palms up to the villa on the hill. Every shadowy nook, where",Little Women
514,"seats invited one to stop and rest, was a mass of bloom, every cool",Little Women
514,grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers and every,Little Women
514,"fountain reflected crimson, white, or pale pink roses, leaning down to",Little Women
514,"smile at their own beauty. Roses covered the walls of the house, draped",Little Women
514,"the cornices, climbed the pillars, and ran riot over the balustrade of",Little Women
514,"the wide terrace, whence one looked down on the sunny Mediterranean,",Little Women
514,and the white-walled city on its shore.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""This is a regular honeymoon paradise, isn't it?  Did you ever see such",Little Women
514,"roses?"" asked Amy, pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view, and a",Little Women
514,luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, nor felt such thorns,"" returned Laurie, with his thumb in his",Little Women
514,"mouth, after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that",Little Women
514,grew just beyond his reach.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Try lower down, and pick those that have no thorns,"" said Amy,",Little Women
514,gathering three of the tiny cream-colored ones that starred the wall,Little Women
514,"behind her.  She put them in his buttonhole as a peace offering, and he",Little Women
514,"stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression, for in",Little Women
514,"the Italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition, and",Little Women
514,"he was just then in that state of half-sweet, half-bitter melancholy,",Little Women
514,when imaginative young men find significance in trifles and food for,Little Women
514,romance everywhere. He had thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny,Little Women
514,"red rose, for vivid flowers became her, and she had often worn ones",Little Women
514,like that from the greenhouse at home.  The pale roses Amy gave him,Little Women
514,"were the sort that the Italians lay in dead hands, never in bridal",Little Women
514,"wreaths, and for a moment he wondered if the omen was for Jo or for",Little Women
514,"himself, but the next instant his American common sense got the better",Little Women
514,"of sentimentality, and he laughed a heartier laugh than Amy had heard",Little Women
514,since he came.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's good advice, you'd better take it and save your fingers,"" she",Little Women
514,"said, thinking her speech amused him.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Thank you, I will,"" he answered in jest, and a few months later he did",Little Women
514,it in earnest.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?"" she asked presently,",Little Women
514,as she settled herself on a rustic seat.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Very soon.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks.""",Little Women

514,"""I dare say, short answers save trouble.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""He expects you, and you really ought to go.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Hospitable creature!  I know it.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Then why don't you do it?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Natural depravity, I suppose.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Natural indolence, you mean.  It's really dreadful!"" and Amy looked",Little Women
514,severe.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not so bad as it seems, for I should only plague him if I went, so I",Little Women
514,"might as well stay and plague you a little longer, you can bear it",Little Women
514,"better, in fact I think it agrees with you excellently,"" and Laurie",Little Women
514,composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Amy shook her head and opened her sketchbook with an air of,Little Women
514,"resignation, but she had made up her mind to lecture 'that boy' and in",Little Women
514,a minute she began again.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What are you doing just now?""",Little Women

514,"""Watching lizards.""",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""How provoking you are!  I don't approve of cigars and I will only",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""With all the pleasure in life.  How will you have me, full length or",Little Women

514,"niente'.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Stay as you are, and go to sleep if you like.  I intend to work hard,""",Little Women
514,said Amy in her most energetic tone.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What delightful enthusiasm!"" and he leaned against a tall urn with an",Little Women
514,air of entire satisfaction.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What would Jo say if she saw you now?"" asked Amy impatiently, hoping",Little Women
514,to stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic sister's name.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""As usual, 'Go away, Teddy.  I'm busy!'"" He laughed as he spoke, but",Little Women
514,"the laugh was not natural, and a shade passed over his face, for the",Little Women
514,utterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed,Little Women
514,"yet.  Both tone and shadow struck Amy, for she had seen and heard them",Little Women
514,"before, and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on",Little Women
514,"Laurie's face--a hard bitter look, full of pain, dissatisfaction, and",Little Women
514,regret.  It was gone before she could study it and the listless,Little Women
514,expression back again. She watched him for a moment with artistic,Little Women
514,"pleasure, thinking how like an Italian he looked, as he lay basking in",Little Women
514,"the sun with uncovered head and eyes full of southern dreaminess, for",Little Women
514,he seemed to have forgotten her and fallen into a reverie.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb,"" she",Little Women
514,"said, carefully tracing the well-cut profile defined against the dark",Little Women

514,"""That's a foolish wish, unless you have spoiled your life. You are so",Little Women

514,"half-wistful look, more significant than her unfinished speech.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated,Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,That satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry,Little Women

514,"""I'm glad of that!  I didn't think you'd been a very bad boy, but I",Little Women

514,"""Never,"" she answered, with a despondent but decided air. ""Rome took",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""He is rich, a gentleman, and has delightful manners,"" began Amy,",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""I understand.  Queens of society can't get on without money, so you",Little Women

514,"""True, nevertheless.""",Little Women

514,contrasted curiously with the young speaker.  Laurie felt this,Little Women
514,"instinctively and laid himself down again, with a sense of",Little Women
514,"disappointment which he could not explain.  His look and silence, as",Little Women
514,"well as a certain inward self-disapproval, ruffled Amy, and made her",Little Women
514,resolve to deliver her lecture without delay.,Little Women

514,"someone to tease, after his long abstinence from his favorite pastime.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You'd be angry in five minutes.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""You don't know what I can do.  Snow produces a glow and a tingle, if",Little Women

514,"with you.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, very selfish,"" continued Amy, in a calm, cool voice, twice as",Little Women
514,"effective just then as an angry one.  ""I'll show you how, for I've",Little Women
514,"studied you while we were frolicking, and I'm not at all satisfied with",Little Women

514,"had improved.  Now I take it all back, for I don't think you half so",Little Women
514,"nice as when I left you at home.  You have grown abominably lazy, you",Little Women
514,"like gossip, and waste time on frivolous things, you are contented to",Little Women
514,"be petted and admired by silly people, instead of being loved and",Little Women
514,"respected by wise ones.  With money, talent, position, health, and",Little Women

514,"help saying it, with all these splendid things to use and enjoy, you",Little Women

514,both pain and pity in it.,Little Women

514,"""Saint Laurence on a gridiron,"" added Laurie, blandly finishing the",Little Women
514,"sentence.  But the lecture began to take effect, for there was a",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""I supposed you'd take it so.  You men tell us we are angels, and say",Little Women

514,"good, you laugh at us and won't listen, which proves how much your",Little Women
514,"flattery is worth."" Amy spoke bitterly, and turned her back on the",Little Women
514,exasperating martyr at her feet.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"In a minute a hand came down over the page, so that she could not draw,",Little Women

514,"will be good, oh, I will be good!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"But Amy did not laugh, for she was in earnest, and tapping on the",Little Women
514,"outspread hand with her pencil, said soberly, ""Aren't you ashamed of a",Little Women
514,"hand like that?  It's as soft and white as a woman's, and looks as if",Little Women
514,it never did anything but wear Jouvin's best gloves and pick flowers,Little Women
514,"for ladies.  You are not a dandy, thank Heaven, so I'm glad to see",Little Women
514,"there are no diamonds or big seal rings on it, only the little old one",Little Women
514,"Jo gave you so long ago.  Dear soul, I wish she was here to help me!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""So do I!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The hand vanished as suddenly as it came, and there was energy enough",Little Women
514,in the echo of her wish to suit even Amy.  She glanced down at him with,Little Women
514,"a new thought in her mind, but he was lying with his hat half over his",Little Women
514,"face, as if for shade, and his mustache hid his mouth.  She only saw",Little Women
514,"his chest rise and fall, with a long breath that might have been a",Little Women
514,"sigh, and the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass, as",Little Women
514,if to hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of. All in,Little Women
514,a minute various hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in,Little Women
514,"Amy's mind, and told her what her sister never had confided to her.",Little Women
514,"She remembered that Laurie never spoke voluntarily of Jo, she recalled",Little Women
514,"the shadow on his face just now, the change in his character, and the",Little Women
514,wearing of the little old ring which was no ornament to a handsome,Little Women
514,hand.  Girls are quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence.,Little Women
514,Amy had fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the,Little Women
514,"alteration, and now she was sure of it.  Her keen eyes filled, and when",Little Women
514,"she spoke again, it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and",Little Women
514,kind when she chose to make it so.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I know I have no right to talk so to you, Laurie, and if you weren't",Little Women
514,"the sweetest-tempered fellow in the world, you'd be very angry with me.",Little Women
514,"But we are all so fond and proud of you, I couldn't bear to think they",Little Women
514,"should be disappointed in you at home as I have been, though, perhaps",Little Women
514,"they would understand the change better than I do.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I think they would,"" came from under the hat, in a grim tone, quite as",Little Women
514,touching as a broken one.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""They ought to have told me, and not let me go blundering and scolding,",Little Women
514,when I should have been more kind and patient than ever.  I never did,Little Women
514,"like that Miss Randal and now I hate her!"" said artful Amy, wishing to",Little Women
514,be sure of her facts this time.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Hang Miss Randal!"" and Laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look",Little Women
514,that left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young lady.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I beg pardon, I thought..."" and there she paused diplomatically.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, you didn't, you knew perfectly well I never cared for anyone but",Little Women

514,away as he spoke.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I did think so, but as they never said anything about it, and you came",Little Women
514,"away, I supposed I was mistaken.  And Jo wouldn't be kind to you?  Why,",Little Women
514,"I was sure she loved you dearly.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""She was kind, but not in the right way, and it's lucky for her she",Little Women
514,"didn't love me, if I'm the good-for-nothing fellow you think me.  It's",Little Women
514,"her fault though, and you may tell her so.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The hard, bitter look came back again as he said that, and it troubled",Little Women
514,"Amy, for she did not know what balm to apply.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I was wrong, I didn't know.  I'm very sorry I was so cross, but I",Little Women
514,"can't help wishing you'd bear it better, Teddy, dear.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't, that's her name for me!"" and Laurie put up his hand with a",Little Women
514,"quick gesture to stop the words spoken in Jo's half-kind,",Little Women
514,"half-reproachful tone.  ""Wait till you've tried it yourself,"" he added",Little Women
514,"in a low voice, as he pulled up the grass by the handful.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'd take it manfully, and be respected if I couldn't be loved,"" said",Little Women
514,"Amy, with the decision of one who knew nothing about it.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Now, Laurie flattered himself that he had borne it remarkably well,",Little Women
514,"making no moan, asking no sympathy, and taking his trouble away to live",Little Women
514,"it down alone.  Amy's lecture put the matter in a new light, and for",Little Women
514,the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first,Little Women
514,"failure, and shut himself up in moody indifference.  He felt as if",Little Women
514,suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream and found it impossible to go to,Little Women
514,"sleep again.  Presently he sat up and asked slowly, ""Do you think Jo",Little Women
514,"would despise me as you do?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, if she saw you now.  She hates lazy people.  Why don't you do",Little Women
514,"something splendid, and make her love you?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I did my best, but it was no use.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Graduating well, you mean?  That was no more than you ought to have",Little Women
514,"done, for your grandfather's sake.  It would have been shameful to fail",Little Women
514,"after spending so much time and money, when everyone knew that you",Little Women
514,"could do well.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I did fail, say what you will, for Jo wouldn't love me,"" began Laurie,",Little Women
514,leaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, you didn't, and you'll say so in the end, for it did you good, and",Little Women
514,proved that you could do something if you tried. If you'd only set,Little Women
514,"about another task of some sort, you'd soon be your hearty, happy self",Little Women
514,"again, and forget your trouble.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That's impossible.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Try it and see.  You needn't shrug your shoulders, and think, 'Much",Little Women
514,"she knows about such things'.  I don't pretend to be wise, but I am",Little Women
514,"observing, and I see a great deal more than you'd imagine.  I'm",Little Women
514,"interested in other people's experiences and inconsistencies, and",Little Women
514,"though I can't explain, I remember and use them for my own benefit.",Little Women
514,"Love Jo all your days, if you choose, but don't let it spoil you, for",Little Women
514,it's wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you can't have the,Little Women
514,"one you want.  There, I won't lecture any more, for I know you'll wake",Little Women
514,"up and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Neither spoke for several minutes.  Laurie sat turning the little ring,Little Women
514,"on his finger, and Amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had",Little Women
514,"been working at while she talked. Presently she put it on his knee,",Little Women
514,"merely saying, ""How do you like that?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He looked and then he smiled, as he could not well help doing, for it",Little Women
514,"was capitally done, the long, lazy figure on the grass, with listless",Little Women
514,"face, half-shut eyes, and one hand holding a cigar, from which came the",Little Women
514,little wreath of smoke that encircled the dreamer's head.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How well you draw!"" he said, with a genuine surprise and pleasure at",Little Women
514,"her skill, adding, with a half-laugh, ""Yes, that's me.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""As you are.  This is as you were."" and Amy laid another sketch beside",Little Women
514,the one he held.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It was not nearly so well done, but there was a life and spirit in it",Little Women
514,"which atoned for many faults, and it recalled the past so vividly that",Little Women
514,a sudden change swept over the young man's face as he looked.  Only a,Little Women
514,"rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse.  Hat and coat were off, and",Little Women
514,"every line of the active figure, resolute face, and commanding attitude",Little Women
514,"was full of energy and meaning.  The handsome brute, just subdued,",Little Women
514,"stood arching his neck under the tightly drawn rein, with one foot",Little Women
514,"impatiently pawing the ground, and ears pricked up as if listening for",Little Women
514,"the voice that had mastered him.  In the ruffled mane, the rider's",Little Women
514,"breezy hair and erect attitude, there was a suggestion of suddenly",Little Women
514,"arrested motion, of strength, courage, and youthful buoyancy that",Little Women
514,contrasted sharply with the supine grace of the '_Dolce far Niente_',Little Women
514,"sketch.  Laurie said nothing but as his eye went from one to the other,",Little Women
514,Amy saw him flush up and fold his lips together as if he read and,Little Women
514,"accepted the little lesson she had given him.  That satisfied her, and",Little Women
514,"without waiting for him to speak, she said, in her sprightly way...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Don't you remember the day you played Rarey with Puck, and we all",Little Women
514,"looked on?  Meg and Beth were frightened, but Jo clapped and pranced,",Little Women
514,and I sat on the fence and drew you.  I found that sketch in my,Little Women
514,"portfolio the other day, touched it up, and kept it to show you.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Much obliged.  You've improved immensely since then, and I",Little Women

514,"that five o'clock is the dinner hour at your hotel?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie rose as he spoke, returned the pictures with a smile and a bow",Little Women
514,"and looked at his watch, as if to remind her that even moral lectures",Little Women
514,"should have an end.  He tried to resume his former easy, indifferent",Little Women
514,"air, but it was an affectation now, for the rousing had been more",Little Women
514,effacious than he would confess.  Amy felt the shade of coldness in his,Little Women
514,"manner, and said to herself...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Now, I've offended him.  Well, if it does him good, I'm glad, if it",Little Women

514,"word of it.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"They laughed and chatted all the way home, and little Baptiste, up",Little Women
514,"behind, thought that monsieur and madamoiselle were in charming",Little Women
514,spirits.  But both felt ill at ease.  The friendly frankness was,Little Women
514,"disturbed, the sunshine had a shadow over it, and despite their",Little Women
514,"apparent gaiety, there was a secret discontent in the heart of each.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Shall we see you this evening, mon frere?"" asked Amy, as they parted",Little Women
514,at her aunt's door.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Unfortunately I have an engagement.  Au revoir, madamoiselle,"" and",Little Women
514,"Laurie bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion, which",Little Women
514,became him better than many men.  Something in his face made Amy say,Little Women
514,quickly and warmly...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way. I'd",Little Women

514,the fruit she loved and longed for.  Old Hannah never wearied of,Little Women
514,"concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite, dropping tears",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Here, cherished like a household saint in its shrine, sat Beth,",Little Women
514,"tranquil and busy as ever, for nothing could change the sweet,",Little Women
514,"unselfish nature, and even while preparing to leave life, she tried to",Little Women
514,make it happier for those who should remain behind.  The feeble fingers,Little Women
514,"were never idle, and one of her pleasures was to make little things for",Little Women
514,"the school children daily passing to and fro, to drop a pair of mittens",Little Women
514,"from her window for a pair of purple hands, a needlebook for some small",Little Women
514,"mother of many dolls, penwipers for young penmen toiling through",Little Women

514,"of pleasant devices, till the reluctant climbers of the ladder of",Little Women

514,"regard the gentle giver as a sort of fairy godmother, who sat above",Little Women
514,"there, and showered down gifts miraculously suited to their tastes and",Little Women

514,It was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as,Little Women
514,"preparation for the sad hours to come, for by-and-by, Beth said the",Little Women
514,"needle was 'so heavy', and put it down forever.  Talking wearied her,",Little Women
514,"faces troubled her, pain claimed her for its own, and her tranquil",Little Women
514,spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her feeble,Little Women
514,"flesh.  Ah me! Such heavy days, such long, long nights, such aching",Little Women
514,"hearts and imploring prayers, when those who loved her best were forced",Little Women
514,"to see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly, to hear the",Little Women
514,"bitter cry, ""Help me, help me!"" and to feel that there was no help.  A",Little Women
514,"sad eclipse of the serene soul, a sharp struggle of the young life with",Little Women
514,"death, but both were mercifully brief, and then the natural rebellion",Little Women
514,"over, the old peace returned more beautiful than ever.  With the wreck",Little Women
514,"of her frail body, Beth's soul grew strong, and though she said little,",Little Women
514,"those about her felt that she was ready, saw that the first pilgrim",Little Women
514,"called was likewise the fittest, and waited with her on the shore,",Little Women
514,trying to see the Shining Ones coming to receive her when she crossed,Little Women
514,the river.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo never left her for an hour since Beth had said ""I feel stronger when",Little Women
514,"you are here.""  She slept on a couch in the room, waking often to renew",Little Women
514,"the fire, to feed, lift, or wait upon the patient creature who seldom",Little Women
514,"asked for anything, and 'tried not to be a trouble'.  All day she",Little Women
514,"haunted the room, jealous of any other nurse, and prouder of being",Little Women
514,chosen then than of any honor her life ever brought her.  Precious and,Little Women
514,"helpful hours to Jo, for now her heart received the teaching that it",Little Women
514,needed.  Lessons in patience were so sweetly taught her that she could,Little Women
514,"not fail to learn them, charity for all, the lovely spirit that can",Little Women
514,"forgive and truly forget unkindness, the loyalty to duty that makes the",Little Women
514,"hardest easy, and the sincere faith that fears nothing, but trusts",Little Women
514,undoubtingly.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Often when she woke Jo found Beth reading in her well-worn little book,",Little Women
514,"heard her singing softly, to beguile the sleepless night, or saw her",Little Women
514,"lean her face upon her hands, while slow tears dropped through the",Little Women
514,"transparent fingers, and Jo would lie watching her with thoughts too",Little Women
514,"deep for tears, feeling that Beth, in her simple, unselfish way, was",Little Women
514,"trying to wean herself from the dear old life, and fit herself for the",Little Women
514,"life to come, by sacred words of comfort, quiet prayers, and the music",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Seeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons, the saintliest",Little Women

514,"eyes made clear by many tears, and a heart softened by the tenderest",Little Women
514,"sorrow, she recognized the beauty of her sister's life--uneventful,",Little Women
514,"unambitious, yet full of the genuine virtues which 'smell sweet, and",Little Women

514,"Blurred and blotted, faulty and feeble as the lines were, they brought",Little Women

514,"been that she had done so little, and this seemed to assure her that",Little Women
514,"her life had not been useless, that her death would not bring the",Little Women
514,despair she feared.  As she sat with the paper folded between her,Little Women
514,"hands, the charred log fell asunder.  Jo started up, revived the blaze,",Little Women
514,"and crept to the bedside, hoping Beth slept.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not asleep, but so happy, dear.  See, I found this and read it. I knew",Little Women

514,"wistful, humble earnestness.",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Then I don't feel as if I'd wasted my life.  I'm not so good as you",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""More than any one in the world, Beth.  I used to think I couldn't let",Little Women

514,"remember that I don't forget you, and that you'll be happier in doing",Little Women

514,"the only thing that we can carry with us when we go, and it makes the",Little Women
514,"end so easy.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll try, Beth."" and then and there Jo renounced her old ambition,",Little Women
514,"pledged herself to a new and better one, acknowledging the poverty of",Little Women

514,immortality of love.,Little Women

514,"So the spring days came and went, the sky grew clearer, the earth",Little Women
514,"greener, the flowers were up fairly early, and the birds came back in",Little Women
514,"time to say goodbye to Beth, who, like a tired but trustful child,",Little Women
514,"clung to the hands that had led her all her life, as Father and Mother",Little Women

514,"as sleep.  As Beth had hoped, the 'tide went out easily', and in the",Little Women
514,"dark hour before dawn, on the bosom where she had drawn her first",Little Women

514,"With tears and prayers and tender hands, Mother and sisters made her",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,LEARNING TO FORGET,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Amy's lecture did Laurie good, though, of course, he did not own it",Little Women
514,"till long afterward.  Men seldom do, for when women are the advisers,",Little Women
514,the lords of creation don't take the advice till they have persuaded,Little Women
514,themselves that it is just what they intended to do.  Then they act,Little Women
514,"upon it, and, if it succeeds, they give the weaker vessel half the",Little Women
514,"credit of it.  If it fails, they generously give her the whole.  Laurie",Little Women
514,"went back to his grandfather, and was so dutifully devoted for several",Little Women
514,weeks that the old gentleman declared the climate of Nice had improved,Little Women
514,"him wonderfully, and he had better try it again. There was nothing the",Little Women
514,"young gentleman would have liked better, but elephants could not have",Little Women
514,"dragged him back after the scolding he had received.  Pride forbid, and",Little Women
514,"whenever the longing grew very strong, he fortified his resolution by",Little Women
514,"repeating the words that had made the deepest impression--""I despise",Little Women
514,"you."" ""Go and do something splendid that will make her love you.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon brought,Little Women
514,"himself to confess that he had been selfish and lazy, but then when a",Little Women
514,"man has a great sorrow, he should be indulged in all sorts of vagaries",Little Women
514,till he has lived it down.  He felt that his blighted affections were,Little Women
514,"quite dead now, and though he should never cease to be a faithful",Little Women
514,"mourner, there was no occasion to wear his weeds ostentatiously.  Jo",Little Women
514,"wouldn't love him, but he might make her respect and admire him by",Little Women
514,doing something which should prove that a girl's 'No' had not spoiled,Little Women
514,"his life.  He had always meant to do something, and Amy's advice was",Little Women
514,quite unnecessary.  He had only been waiting till the aforesaid,Little Women
514,"blighted affections were decently interred. That being done, he felt",Little Women
514,"that he was ready to 'hide his stricken heart, and still toil on'.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As Goethe, when he had a joy or a grief, put it into a song, so Laurie",Little Women
514,"resolved to embalm his love sorrow in music, and to compose a Requiem",Little Women
514,which should harrow up Jo's soul and melt the heart of every hearer.,Little Women
514,Therefore the next time the old gentleman found him getting restless,Little Women
514,"and moody and ordered him off, he went to Vienna, where he had musical",Little Women
514,"friends, and fell to work with the firm determination to distinguish",Little Women
514,"himself.  But whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music,",Little Women
514,"or music too ethereal to uplift a mortal woe, he soon discovered that",Little Women
514,the Requiem was beyond him just at present.  It was evident that his,Little Women
514,"mind was not in working order yet, and his ideas needed clarifying, for",Little Women
514,"often in the middle of a plaintive strain, he would find himself",Little Women
514,humming a dancing tune that vividly recalled the Christmas ball at,Little Women
514,"Nice, especially the stout Frenchman, and put an effectual stop to",Little Women
514,tragic composition for the time being.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Then he tried an opera, for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning,",Little Women
514,but here again unforeseen difficulties beset him.  He wanted Jo for his,Little Women
514,"heroine, and called upon his memory to supply him with tender",Little Women
514,recollections and romantic visions of his love.  But memory turned,Little Women
514,"traitor, and as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl, would",Little Women
514,"only recall Jo's oddities, faults, and freaks, would only show her in",Little Women
514,the most unsentimental aspects--beating mats with her head tied up in a,Little Women
514,"bandanna, barricading herself with the sofa pillow, or throwing cold",Little Women
514,water over his passion a la Gummidge--and an irresistable laugh spoiled,Little Women
514,the pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint.  Jo wouldn't be put,Little Women
514,"into the opera at any price, and he had to give her up with a ""Bless",Little Women
514,"that girl, what a torment she is!"" and a clutch at his hair, as became",Little Women
514,a distracted composer.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,When he looked about him for another and a less intractable damsel to,Little Women
514,"immortalize in melody, memory produced one with the most obliging",Little Women
514,"readiness.  This phantom wore many faces, but it always had golden",Little Women
514,"hair, was enveloped in a diaphanous cloud, and floated airily before",Little Women
514,"his mind's eye in a pleasing chaos of roses, peacocks, white ponies,",Little Women
514,"and blue ribbons.  He did not give the complacent wraith any name, but",Little Women
514,"he took her for his heroine and grew quite fond of her, as well he",Little Women
514,"might, for he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun, and",Little Women
514,"escorted her, unscathed, through trials which would have annihilated",Little Women
514,any mortal woman.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Thanks to this inspiration, he got on swimmingly for a time, but",Little Women
514,"gradually the work lost its charm, and he forgot to compose, while he",Little Women
514,"sat musing, pen in hand, or roamed about the gay city to get some new",Little Women
514,"ideas and refresh his mind, which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled",Little Women
514,"state that winter.  He did not do much, but he thought a great deal and",Little Women
514,was conscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself.,Little Women
514,"""It's genius simmering, perhaps.  I'll let it simmer, and see what",Little Women
514,"comes of it,"" he said, with a secret suspicion all the while that it",Little Women
514,"wasn't genius, but something far more common.  Whatever it was, it",Little Women
514,"simmered to some purpose, for he grew more and more discontented with",Little Women
514,"his desultory life, began to long for some real and earnest work to go",Little Women
514,"at, soul and body, and finally came to the wise conclusion that",Little Women
514,everyone who loved music was not a composer.  Returning from one of,Little Women
514,"Mozart's grand operas, splendidly performed at the Royal Theatre, he",Little Women
514,"looked over his own, played a few of the best parts, sat staring at the",Little Women
514,"busts of Mendelssohn, Beethoven, and Bach, who stared benignly back",Little Women
514,"again.  Then suddenly he tore up his music sheets, one by one, and as",Little Women
514,"the last fluttered out of his hand, he said soberly to himself...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""She is right!  Talent isn't genius, and you can't make it so.  That",Little Women
514,"music has taken the vanity out of me as Rome took it out of her, and I",Little Women
514,"won't be a humbug any longer.  Now what shall I do?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"That seemed a hard question to answer, and Laurie began to wish he had",Little Women
514,"to work for his daily bread.  Now if ever, occurred an eligible",Little Women
514,"opportunity for 'going to the devil', as he once forcibly expressed it,",Little Women
514,"for he had plenty of money and nothing to do, and Satan is proverbially",Little Women
514,fond of providing employment for full and idle hands.  The poor fellow,Little Women
514,"had temptations enough from without and from within, but he withstood",Little Women
514,"them pretty well, for much as he valued liberty, he valued good faith",Little Women
514,"and confidence more, so his promise to his grandfather, and his desire",Little Women
514,"to be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him,",Little Women
514,"and say ""All's well,"" kept him safe and steady.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Very likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe, ""I don't believe it, boys",Little Women
514,"will be boys, young men must sow their wild oats, and women must not",Little Women
514,"expect miracles.""  I dare say you don't, Mrs. Grundy, but it's true",Little Women
514,"nevertheless.  Women work a good many miracles, and I have a persuasion",Little Women
514,that they may perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by,Little Women
514,"refusing to echo such sayings.  Let the boys be boys, the longer the",Little Women
514,"better, and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must.  But",Little Women
514,"mothers, sisters, and friends may help to make the crop a small one,",Little Women
514,"and keep many tares from spoiling the harvest, by believing, and",Little Women
514,"showing that they believe, in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues",Little Women
514,which make men manliest in good women's eyes.  If it is a feminine,Little Women
514,"delusion, leave us to enjoy it while we may, for without it half the",Little Women
514,"beauty and the romance of life is lost, and sorrowful forebodings would",Little Women
514,"embitter all our hopes of the brave, tenderhearted little lads, who",Little Women
514,still love their mothers better than themselves and are not ashamed to,Little Women
514,own it.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Laurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for Jo would absorb,Little Women
514,"all his powers for years, but to his great surprise he discovered it",Little Women
514,"grew easier every day.  He refused to believe it at first, got angry",Little Women
514,"with himself, and couldn't understand it, but these hearts of ours are",Little Women
514,"curious and contrary things, and time and nature work their will in",Little Women
514,spite of us.  Laurie's heart wouldn't ache.  The wound persisted in,Little Women
514,"healing with a rapidity that astonished him, and instead of trying to",Little Women
514,"forget, he found himself trying to remember.  He had not foreseen this",Little Women
514,"turn of affairs, and was not prepared for it.  He was disgusted with",Little Women
514,"himself, surprised at his own fickleness, and full of a queer mixture",Little Women
514,of disappointment and relief that he could recover from such a,Little Women
514,tremendous blow so soon.  He carefully stirred up the embers of his,Little Women
514,"lost love, but they refused to burst into a blaze.  There was only a",Little Women
514,comfortable glow that warmed and did him good without putting him into,Little Women
514,"a fever, and he was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish",Little Women
514,"passion was slowly subsiding into a more tranquil sentiment, very",Little Women
514,"tender, a little sad and resentful still, but that was sure to pass",Little Women
514,"away in time, leaving a brotherly affection which would last unbroken",Little Women
514,to the end.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As the word 'brotherly' passed through his mind in one of his reveries,",Little Women
514,"he smiled, and glanced up at the picture of Mozart that was before",Little Women
514,him...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, he was a great man, and when he couldn't have one sister he took",Little Women
514,"the other, and was happy.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie did not utter the words, but he thought them, and the next",Little Women
514,"instant kissed the little old ring, saying to himself, ""No, I won't!  I",Little Women
514,"haven't forgotten, I never can.  I'll try again, and if that fails, why",Little Women
514,"then...""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Leaving his sentence unfinished, he seized pen and paper and wrote to",Little Women
514,"Jo, telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was",Little Women
514,"the least hope of her changing her mind. Couldn't she, wouldn't",Little Women
514,she--and let him come home and be happy? While waiting for an answer he,Little Women
514,"did nothing, but he did it energetically, for he was in a fever of",Little Women
514,"impatience.  It came at last, and settled his mind effectually on one",Little Women
514,"point, for Jo decidedly couldn't and wouldn't.  She was wrapped up in",Little Women
514,"Beth, and never wished to hear the word love again.  Then she begged",Little Women
514,"him to be happy with somebody else, but always keep a little corner of",Little Women
514,his heart for his loving sister Jo.  In a postscript she desired him,Little Women
514,"not to tell Amy that Beth was worse, she was coming home in the spring",Little Women
514,and there was no need of saddening the remainder of her stay.  That,Little Women
514,"would be time enough, please God, but Laurie must write to her often,",Little Women
514,"and not let her feel lonely, homesick or anxious.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""So I will, at once.  Poor little girl, it will be a sad going home for",Little Women
514,"her, I'm afraid,"" and Laurie opened his desk, as if writing to Amy had",Little Women
514,been the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks,Little Women
514,before.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"But he did not write the letter that day, for as he rummaged out his",Little Women
514,"best paper, he came across something which changed his purpose.",Little Women
514,"Tumbling about in one part of the desk among bills, passports, and",Little Women
514,"business documents of various kinds were several of Jo's letters, and",Little Women
514,"in another compartment were three notes from Amy, carefully tied up",Little Women
514,with one of her blue ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the little dead,Little Women
514,"roses put away inside.  With a half-repentant, half-amused expression,",Little Women
514,"Laurie gathered up all Jo's letters, smoothed, folded, and put them",Little Women
514,"neatly into a small drawer of the desk, stood a minute turning the ring",Little Women
514,"thoughtfully on his finger, then slowly drew it off, laid it with the",Little Women
514,"letters, locked the drawer, and went out to hear High Mass at Saint",Little Women
514,"Stefan's, feeling as if there had been a funeral, and though not",Little Women
514,"overwhelmed with affliction, this seemed a more proper way to spend the",Little Women
514,rest of the day than in writing letters to charming young ladies.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The letter went very soon, however, and was promptly answered, for Amy",Little Women
514,"was homesick, and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding",Little Women
514,"manner.  The correspondence flourished famously, and letters flew to",Little Women
514,and fro with unfailing regularity all through the early spring.  Laurie,Little Women
514,"sold his busts, made allumettes of his opera, and went back to Paris,",Little Women
514,hoping somebody would arrive before long.  He wanted desperately to go,Little Women
514,"to Nice, but would not till he was asked, and Amy would not ask him,",Little Women
514,"for just then she was having little experiences of her own, which made",Little Women
514,her rather wish to avoid the quizzical eyes of 'our boy'.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Fred Vaughn had returned, and put the question to which she had once",Little Women
514,"decided to answer, ""Yes, thank you,"" but now she said, ""No, thank you,""",Little Women
514,"kindly but steadily, for when the time came, her courage failed her,",Little Women
514,and she found that something more than money and position was needed to,Little Women
514,satisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes,Little Women
514,"and fears.  The words, ""Fred is a good fellow, but not at all the man I",Little Women
514,"fancied you would ever like,"" and Laurie's face when he uttered them,",Little Women
514,kept returning to her as pertinaciously as her own did when she said in,Little Women
514,"look, if not in words, ""I shall marry for money.""  It troubled her to",Little Women
514,"remember that now, she wished she could take it back, it sounded so",Little Women
514,"unwomanly. She didn't want Laurie to think her a heartless,  worldly",Little Women
514,creature.  She didn't care to be a queen of society now half so much as,Little Women
514,she did to be a lovable woman.  She was so glad he didn't hate her for,Little Women
514,"the dreadful things she said, but took them so beautifully and was",Little Women
514,"kinder than ever.  His letters were such a comfort, for the home",Little Women
514,letters were very irregular and not half so satisfactory as his when,Little Women
514,"they did come.  It was not only a pleasure, but a duty to answer them,",Little Women
514,"for the poor fellow was forlorn, and needed petting, since Jo persisted",Little Women
514,in being stonyhearted.  She ought to have made an effort and tried to,Little Women
514,"love him.  It couldn't be very hard, many people would be proud and",Little Women
514,glad to have such a dear boy care for them.  But Jo never would act,Little Women
514,"like other girls, so there was nothing to do but be very kind and treat",Little Women
514,him like a brother.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"If all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at this period, they",Little Women
514,would be a much happier race of beings than they are.  Amy never,Little Women
514,"lectured now.  She asked his opinion on all subjects, she was",Little Women
514,"interested in everything he did, made charming little presents for him,",Little Women
514,"and sent him two letters a week, full of lively gossip, sisterly",Little Women
514,"confidences, and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her.",Little Women
514,As few brothers are complimented by having their letters carried about,Little Women
514,"in their sister's pockets, read and reread diligently, cried over when",Little Women
514,"short, kissed when long, and treasured carefully, we will not hint that",Little Women
514,Amy did any of these fond and foolish things.  But she certainly did,Little Women
514,"grow a little pale and pensive that spring, lost much of her relish for",Little Women
514,"society, and went out sketching alone a good deal.  She never had much",Little Women
514,"to show when she came home, but was studying nature, I dare say, while",Little Women
514,"she sat for hours, with her hands folded, on the terrace at Valrosa, or",Little Women
514,"absently sketched any fancy that occurred to her, a stalwart knight",Little Women
514,"carved on a tomb, a young man asleep in the grass, with his hat over",Little Women
514,"his eyes, or a curly haired girl in gorgeous array, promenading down a",Little Women
514,"ballroom on the arm of a tall gentleman, both faces being left a blur",Little Women
514,"according to the last fashion in art, which was safe but not altogether",Little Women
514,satisfactory.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to Fred, and finding",Little Women
514,"denials useless and explanations impossible, Amy left her to think what",Little Women
514,"she liked, taking care that Laurie should know that Fred had gone to",Little Women
514,"Egypt.  That was all, but he understood it, and looked relieved, as he",Little Women
514,"said to himself, with a venerable air...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I was sure she would think better of it.  Poor old fellow! I've been",Little Women
514,"through it all, and I can sympathize.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"With that he heaved a great sigh, and then, as if he had discharged his",Little Women
514,"duty to the past, put his feet up on the sofa and enjoyed Amy's letter",Little Women
514,luxuriously.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"While these changes were going on abroad, trouble had come at home.",Little Women
514,"But the letter telling that Beth was failing never reached Amy, and",Little Women
514,when they next found her the grass was green above her sister. The sad,Little Women
514,"news met her at at Vevay, for the heat had driven them from Nice in",Little Women
514,"May, and they had travelled slowly to Switzerland, by way of Genoa and",Little Women
514,"the Italian lakes.  She bore it very well, and quietly submitted to",Little Women
514,"the family decree that she should not shorten her visit, for since it",Little Women
514,"was too late to say goodbye to Beth, she had better stay, and let",Little Women
514,"absence soften her sorrow.  But her heart was very heavy, she longed",Little Women
514,"to be at home, and every day looked wistfully across the lake, waiting",Little Women
514,for Laurie to come and comfort her.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He did come very soon, for the same mail brought letters to them both,",Little Women
514,"but he was in Germany, and it took some days to reach him.  The moment",Little Women
514,"he read it, he packed his knapsack, bade adieu to his fellow",Little Women
514,"pedestrians, and was off to keep his promise, with a heart full of joy",Little Women
514,"and sorrow, hope and suspense.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He knew Vevay well, and as soon as the boat touched the little quay, he",Little Women
514,"hurried along the shore to La Tour, where the Carrols were living en",Little Women
514,pension.  The garcon was in despair that the whole family had gone to,Little Women
514,"take a promenade on the lake, but no, the blonde mademoiselle might be",Little Women
514,in the chateau garden.  If monsieur would give himself the pain of,Little Women
514,"sitting down, a flash of time should present her.  But monsieur could",Little Women
514,"not wait even a 'flash of time', and in the middle of the speech",Little Women
514,departed to find mademoiselle himself.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"A pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake, with chestnuts",Little Women
514,"rustling overhead, ivy climbing everywhere, and the black shadow of the",Little Women
514,"tower falling far across the sunny water.  At one corner of the wide,",Little Women
514,"low wall was a seat, and here Amy often came to read or work, or",Little Women
514,console herself with the beauty all about her.  She was sitting here,Little Women
514,"that day, leaning her head on her hand, with a homesick heart and heavy",Little Women
514,"eyes, thinking of Beth and wondering why Laurie did not come.  She did",Little Women
514,"not hear him cross the courtyard beyond, nor see him pause in the",Little Women
514,archway that led from the subterranean path into the garden.  He stood,Little Women
514,"a minute looking at her with new eyes, seeing what no one had ever seen",Little Women
514,"before, the tender side of Amy's character. Everything about her mutely",Little Women
514,"suggested love and sorrow, the blotted letters in her lap, the black",Little Women
514,"ribbon that tied up her hair, the womanly pain and patience in her",Little Women
514,"face, even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to",Little Women
514,"Laurie, for he had given it to her, and she wore it as her only",Little Women
514,"ornament. If he had any doubts about the reception she would give him,",Little Women
514,"they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him, for",Little Women
514,"dropping everything, she ran to him, exclaiming in a tone of",Little Women
514,unmistakable love and longing...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, Laurie, Laurie, I knew you'd come to me!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"I think everything was said and settled then, for as they stood",Little Women
514,"together quite silent for a moment, with the dark head bent down",Little Women
514,"protectingly over the light one, Amy felt that no one could comfort and",Little Women
514,"sustain her so well as Laurie, and Laurie decided that Amy was the only",Little Women
514,woman in the world who could fill Jo's place and make him happy.  He,Little Women
514,"did not tell her so, but she was not disappointed, for both felt the",Little Women
514,"truth, were satisfied, and gladly left the rest to silence.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"In a minute Amy went back to her place, and while she dried her tears,",Little Women
514,"Laurie gathered up the scattered papers, finding in the sight of sundry",Little Women
514,well-worn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future.,Little Women
514,"As he sat down beside her, Amy felt shy again, and turned rosy red at",Little Women
514,the recollection of her impulsive greeting.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I couldn't help it, I felt so lonely and sad, and was so very glad to",Little Women
514,"see you.  It was such a surprise to look up and find you, just as I was",Little Women
514,"beginning to fear you wouldn't come,"" she said, trying in vain to speak",Little Women
514,quite naturally.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I came the minute I heard.  I wish I could say something to comfort",Little Women
514,"you for the loss of dear little Beth, but I can only feel, and...""  He",Little Women
514,"could not get any further, for he too turned bashful all of a sudden,",Little Women
514,and did not quite know what to say.  He longed to lay Amy's head down,Little Women
514,"on his shoulder, and tell her to have a good cry, but he did not dare,",Little Women
514,"so took her hand instead, and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was",Little Women
514,better than words.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You needn't say anything, this comforts me,"" she said softly.  ""Beth",Little Women
514,"is well and happy, and I mustn't wish her back, but I dread the going",Little Women
514,"home, much as I long to see them all. We won't talk about it now, for",Little Women
514,"it makes me cry, and I want to enjoy you while you stay.  You needn't",Little Women
514,"go right back, need you?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not if you want me, dear.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I do, so much.  Aunt and Flo are very kind, but you seem like one of",Little Women
514,"the family, and it would be so comfortable to have you for a little",Little Women
514,"while.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,Amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart was full that,Little Women
514,"Laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once, and gave her just what she",Little Women
514,wanted--the petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation she,Little Women
514,needed.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Poor little soul, you look as if you'd grieved yourself half sick!",Little Women
514,"I'm going to take care of you, so don't cry any more, but come and walk",Little Women
514,"about with me, the wind is too chilly for you to sit still,"" he said,",Little Women
514,"in the half-caressing, half-commanding way that Amy liked, as he tied",Little Women
514,"on her hat, drew her arm through his, and began to pace up and down the",Little Women
514,sunny walk under the new-leaved chestnuts.  He felt more at ease upon,Little Women
514,"his legs, and Amy found it pleasant to have a strong arm to lean upon,",Little Women
514,"a familiar face to smile at her, and a kind voice to talk delightfully",Little Women
514,for her alone.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers, and seemed",Little Women
514,"expressly made for them, so sunny and secluded was it, with nothing but",Little Women
514,"the tower to overlook them, and the wide lake to carry away the echo of",Little Women
514,"their words, as it rippled by below.  For an hour this new pair walked",Little Women
514,"and talked, or rested on the wall, enjoying the sweet influences which",Little Women
514,"gave such a charm to time and place, and when an unromantic dinner bell",Little Women
514,"warned them away, Amy felt as if she left her burden of loneliness and",Little Women
514,sorrow behind her in the chateau garden.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The moment Mrs. Carrol saw the girl's altered face, she was illuminated",Little Women
514,"with a new idea, and exclaimed to herself, ""Now I understand it",Little Women
514,"all--the child has been pining for young Laurence.  Bless my heart, I",Little Women
514,"never thought of such a thing!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"With praiseworthy discretion, the good lady said nothing, and betrayed",Little Women
514,"no sign of enlightenment, but cordially urged Laurie to stay and begged",Little Women
514,"Amy to enjoy his society, for it would do her more good than so much",Little Women
514,"solitude.  Amy was a model of docility, and as her aunt was a good deal",Little Women
514,"occupied with Flo, she was left to entertain her friend, and did it",Little Women
514,with more than her usual success.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"At Nice, Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded.  At Vevay, Laurie was",Little Women
514,"never idle, but always walking, riding, boating, or studying in the",Little Women
514,"most energetic manner, while Amy admired everything he did and followed",Little Women
514,his example as far and as fast as she could.  He said the change was,Little Women
514,"owing to the climate, and she did not contradict him, being glad of a",Little Women
514,like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The invigorating air did them both good, and much exercise worked",Little Women
514,wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies. They seemed to get,Little Women
514,clearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills.,Little Women
514,"The fresh winds blew away desponding doubts, delusive fancies, and",Little Women
514,moody mists.  The warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of,Little Women
514,"aspiring ideas, tender hopes, and happy thoughts.  The lake seemed to",Little Women
514,"wash away the troubles of the past, and the grand old mountains to look",Little Women
514,"benignly down upon them saying, ""Little children, love one another.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"In spite of the new sorrow, it was a very happy time, so happy that",Little Women
514,Laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word.  It took him a little,Little Women
514,"while to recover from his surprise at the cure of his first, and as he",Little Women
514,"had firmly believed, his last and only love.  He consoled himself for",Little Women
514,the seeming disloyalty by the thought that Jo's sister was almost the,Little Women
514,"same as Jo's self, and the conviction that it would have been",Little Women
514,impossible to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so well.  His,Little Women
514,"first wooing had been of the tempestuous order, and he looked back upon",Little Women
514,it as if through a long vista of years with a feeling of compassion,Little Women
514,"blended with regret.  He was not ashamed of it, but put it away as one",Little Women
514,"of the bitter-sweet experiences of his life, for which he could be",Little Women
514,"grateful when the pain was over. His second wooing, he resolved, should",Little Women
514,be as calm and simple as possible.  There was no need of having a,Little Women
514,"scene, hardly any need of telling Amy that he loved her, she knew it",Little Women
514,without words and had given him his answer long ago.  It all came about,Little Women
514,"so naturally that no one could complain, and he knew that everybody",Little Women
514,"would be pleased, even Jo.  But when our first little passion has been",Little Women
514,"crushed, we are apt to be wary and slow in making a second trial, so",Little Women
514,"Laurie let the days pass, enjoying every hour, and leaving to chance",Little Women
514,the utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and,Little Women
514,sweetest part of his new romance.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,He had rather imagined that the denoument would take place in the,Little Women
514,"chateau garden by moonlight, and in the most graceful and decorous",Little Women
514,"manner, but it turned out exactly the reverse, for the matter was",Little Women
514,settled on the lake at noonday in a few blunt words. They had been,Little Women
514,"floating about all the morning, from gloomy St.  Gingolf to sunny",Little Women
514,"Montreux, with the Alps of Savoy on one side, Mont St.  Bernard and the",Little Women
514,"Dent du Midi on the other, pretty Vevay in the valley, and Lausanne",Little Women
514,"upon the hill beyond, a cloudless blue sky overhead, and the bluer lake",Little Women
514,"below, dotted with the picturesque boats that look like white-winged",Little Women
514,gulls.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"They had been talking of Bonnivard, as they glided past Chillon, and of",Little Women
514,"Rousseau, as they looked up at Clarens, where he wrote his Heloise.",Little Women
514,"Neither had read it, but they knew it was a love story, and each",Little Women
514,privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own.  Amy had,Little Women
514,been dabbling her hand in the water during the little pause that fell,Little Women
514,"between them, and when she looked up, Laurie was leaning on his oars",Little Women
514,"with an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily, merely for",Little Women
514,the sake of saying something...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You must be tired.  Rest a little, and let me row.  It will do me",Little Women
514,"good, for since you came I have been altogether lazy and luxurious.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm not tired, but you may take an oar, if you like.  There's room",Little Women
514,"enough, though I have to sit nearly in the middle, else the boat won't",Little Women
514,"trim,"" returned Laurie, as if he rather liked the arrangement.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Feeling that she had not mended matters much, Amy took the offered",Little Women
514,"third of a seat, shook her hair over her face, and accepted an oar.",Little Women
514,"She rowed as well as she did many other things, and though she used",Little Women
514,"both hands, and Laurie but one, the oars kept time, and the boat went",Little Women
514,smoothly through the water.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How well we pull together, don't we?"" said Amy, who objected to",Little Women
514,silence just then.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""So well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat. Will you,",Little Women
514,"Amy?"" very tenderly.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, Laurie,"" very low.",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,ALL ALONE,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,It was easy to promise self-abnegation when self was wrapped up in,Little Women
514,"another, and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example.  But when",Little Women
514,"the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved",Little Women
514,"presence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then Jo",Little Women
514,found her promise very hard to keep.  How could she 'comfort Father and,Little Women
514,Mother' when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her,Little Women
514,"sister, how could she 'make the house cheerful' when all its light and",Little Women
514,warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when Beth left the old,Little Women
514,"home for the new, and where in all the world could she 'find some",Little Women
514,"useful, happy work to do', that would take the place of the loving",Little Women
514,"service which had been its own reward?  She tried in a blind, hopeless",Little Women
514,"way to do her duty, secretly rebelling against it all the while, for it",Little Women
514,"seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened, her burdens made",Little Women
514,"heavier, and life get harder and harder as she toiled along.  Some",Little Women
514,"people seemed to get all sunshine, and some all shadow.  It was not",Little Women
514,"fair, for she tried more than Amy to be good, but never got any reward,",Little Women
514,"only disappointment, trouble and hard work.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Poor Jo, these were dark days to her, for something like despair came",Little Women
514,"over her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house,",Little Women
514,"devoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures, and the duty that",Little Women
514,"never seemed to grow any easier.  ""I can't do it. I wasn't meant for a",Little Women
514,"life like this, and I know I shall break away and do something",Little Women
514,"desperate if somebody doesn't come and help me,"" she said to herself,",Little Women
514,"when her first efforts failed and she fell into the moody, miserable",Little Women
514,state of mind which often comes when strong wills have to yield to the,Little Women
514,inevitable.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"But someone did come and help her, though Jo did not recognize her good",Little Women
514,angels at once because they wore familiar shapes and used the simple,Little Women
514,"spells best fitted to poor humanity.  Often she started up at night,",Little Women
514,"thinking Beth called her, and when the sight of the little empty bed",Little Women
514,"made her cry with the bitter cry of unsubmissive sorrow, ""Oh, Beth,",Little Women
514,"come back!  Come back!"" she did not stretch out her yearning arms in",Little Women
514,"vain.  For, as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her",Little Women
514,"sister's faintest whisper, her mother came to comfort her, not with",Little Women
514,"words only, but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch, tears",Little Women
514,"that were mute reminders of a greater grief than Jo's, and broken",Little Women
514,"whispers, more eloquent than prayers, because hopeful resignation went",Little Women
514,"hand-in-hand with natural sorrow. Sacred moments, when heart talked to",Little Women
514,"heart in the silence of the night, turning affliction to a blessing,",Little Women
514,"which chastened grief and strengthened love.  Feeling this, Jo's burden",Little Women
514,"seemed easier to bear, duty grew sweeter, and life looked more",Little Women
514,"endurable, seen from the safe shelter of her mother's arms.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"When aching heart was a little comforted, troubled mind likewise found",Little Women
514,"help, for one day she went to the study, and leaning over the good gray",Little Women
514,"head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile, she said very humbly,",Little Women
514,"""Father, talk to me as you did to Beth.  I need it more than she did,",Little Women
514,"for I'm all wrong.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""My dear, nothing can comfort me like this,"" he answered, with a falter",Little Women
514,"in his voice, and both arms round her, as if he too, needed help, and",Little Women
514,did not fear to ask for it.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Then, sitting in Beth's little chair close beside him, Jo told her",Little Women
514,"troubles, the resentful sorrow for her loss, the fruitless efforts that",Little Women
514,"discouraged her, the want of faith that made life look so dark, and all",Little Women
514,the sad bewilderment which we call despair.  She gave him entire,Little Women
514,"confidence, he gave her the help she needed, and both found consolation",Little Women
514,in the act.  For the time had come when they could talk together not,Little Women
514,"only as father and daughter, but as man and woman, able and glad to",Little Women
514,"serve each other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love.  Happy,",Little Women
514,thoughtful times there in the old study which Jo called 'the church of,Little Women
514,"one member', and from which she came with fresh courage, recovered",Little Women
514,"cheerfulness, and a more submissive spirit. For the parents who had",Little Women
514,"taught one child to meet death without fear, were trying now to teach",Little Women
514,"another to accept life without despondency or distrust, and to use its",Little Women
514,beautiful opportunities with gratitude and power.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Other helps had Jo--humble, wholesome duties and delights that would",Little Women
514,"not be denied their part in serving her, and which she slowly learned",Little Women
514,to see and value.  Brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful,Little Women
514,"as they once had been, for Beth had presided over both, and something",Little Women
514,of her housewifely spirit seemed to linger around the little mop and,Little Women
514,"the old brush, never thrown away.  As she used them, Jo found herself",Little Women
514,"humming the songs Beth used to hum, imitating Beth's orderly ways, and",Little Women
514,giving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and,Little Women
514,"cozy, which was the first step toward making home happy, though she",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"As they sat sewing together, Jo discovered how much improved her sister",Little Women

514,the topsy-turvy nursery.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's just what you need to bring out the tender womanly half of your",Little Women
514,"nature, Jo.  You are like a chestnut burr, prickly outside, but",Little Women
514,"silky-soft within, and a sweet kernal, if one can only get at it.  Love",Little Women
514,"will make you show your heart one day, and then the rough burr will",Little Women
514,"fall off.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,"them down.  Boys go nutting, and I don't care to be bagged by them,""",Little Women
514,"returned Jo, pasting away at the kite which no wind that blows would",Little Women
514,"ever carry up, for Daisy had tied herself on as a bob.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Meg laughed, for she was glad to see a glimmer of Jo's old spirit, but",Little Women
514,she felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every argument in her,Little Women
514,"power, and the sisterly chats were not wasted, especially as two of",Little Women
514,"Meg's most effective arguments were the babies, whom Jo loved tenderly.",Little Women
514,"Grief is the best opener of some hearts, and Jo's was nearly ready for",Little Women
514,"the bag.  A little more sunshine to ripen the nut, then, not a boy's",Little Women
514,"impatient shake, but a man's hand reached up to pick it gently from the",Little Women
514,"burr, and find the kernal sound and sweet. If she suspected this, she",Little Women
514,"would have shut up tight, and been more prickly than ever, fortunately",Little Women
514,"she wasn't thinking about herself, so when the time came, down she",Little Women
514,dropped.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Now, if she had been the heroine of a moral storybook, she ought at",Little Women
514,"this period of her life to have become quite saintly, renounced the",Little Women
514,"world, and gone about doing good in a mortified bonnet, with tracts in",Little Women
514,"her pocket.  But, you see, Jo wasn't a heroine, she was only a",Little Women
514,"struggling human girl like hundreds of others, and she just acted out",Little Women
514,"her nature, being sad, cross, listless, or energetic, as the mood",Little Women
514,"suggested.  It's highly virtuous to say we'll be good, but we can't do",Little Women
514,"it all at once, and it takes a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all",Little Women
514,together before some of us even get our feet set in the right way.  Jo,Little Women
514,"had got so far, she was learning to do her duty, and to feel unhappy if",Little Women
514,"she did not, but to do it cheerfully, ah, that was another thing!  She",Little Women
514,"had often said she wanted to do something splendid, no matter how hard,",Little Women
514,"and now she had her wish, for what could be more beautiful than to",Little Women
514,"devote her life to Father and Mother, trying to make home as happy to",Little Women
514,them as they had to her?  And if difficulties were necessary to,Little Women
514,"increase the splendor of the effort, what could be harder for a",Little Women
514,"restless, ambitious girl than to give up her own hopes, plans, and",Little Women
514,"desires, and cheerfully live for others?",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Providence had taken her at her word.  Here was the task, not what she",Little Women
514,"had expected, but better because self had no part in it. Now, could she",Little Women
514,"do it?  She decided that she would try, and in her first attempt she",Little Women
514,"found the helps I have suggested.  Still another was given her, and she",Little Women
514,"took it, not as a reward, but as a comfort, as Christian took the",Little Women

514,her half-finished manuscripts.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"An hour afterward her mother peeped in and there she was, scratching",Little Women
514,"away, with her black pinafore on, and an absorbed expression, which",Little Women
514,"caused Mrs. March to smile and slip away, well pleased with the success",Little Women
514,"of her suggestion.  Jo never knew how it happened, but something got",Little Women
514,"into that story that went straight to the hearts of those who read it,",Little Women
514,"for when her family had laughed and cried over it, her father sent it,",Little Women
514,"much against her will, to one of the popular magazines, and to her",Little Women
514,"utter surprise, it was not only paid for, but others requested.",Little Women
514,"Letters from several persons, whose praise was honor, followed the",Little Women
514,"appearance of the little story, newspapers copied it, and strangers as",Little Women

514,and Jo was more astonished than when her novel was commended and,Little Women
514,condemned all at once.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I don't understand it.  What can there be in a simple little story",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""There is truth in it, Jo, that's the secret.  Humor and pathos make it",Little Women

514,father's words than by any amount of praise from the world.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"So taught by love and sorrow, Jo wrote her little stories, and sent",Little Women
514,"them away to make friends for themselves and her, finding it a very",Little Women

514,"When Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement, Mrs. March feared that",Little Women

514,"quietly, and was full of hopes and plans for 'the children' before she",Little Women
514,"read the letter twice.  It was a sort of written duet, wherein each",Little Women

514,"By-and-by Jo roamed away upstairs, for it was rainy, and she could not",Little Women

514,"not bitter as it once was, but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one",Little Women
514,"sister should have all she asked, the other nothing.  It was not true,",Little Women
514,"she knew that and tried to put it away, but the natural craving for",Little Women

514,"stood four little wooden chests in a row, each marked with its owners",Little Women

514,"drew them out, turned them over, and relived that pleasant winter at",Little Women
514,"kind Mrs. Kirke's.  She had smiled at first, then she looked",Little Women
514,"thoughtful, next sad, and when she came to a little message written in",Little Women
514,"the Professor's hand, her lips began to tremble, the books slid out of",Little Women
514,"her lap, and she sat looking at the friendly words, as they took a new",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Jo was alone in the twilight, lying on the old sofa, looking at the",Little Women
514,"fire, and thinking.  It was her favorite way of spending the hour of",Little Women
514,"dusk.  No one disturbed her, and she used to lie there on Beth's little",Little Women
514,"red pillow, planning stories, dreaming dreams, or thinking tender",Little Women
514,thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away.  Her face looked,Little Women
514,"tired, grave, and rather sad, for tomorrow was her birthday, and she",Little Women
514,"was thinking how fast the years went by, how old she was getting, and",Little Women
514,"how little she seemed to have accomplished.  Almost twenty-five, and",Little Women
514,nothing to show for it.  Jo was mistaken in that.  There was a good,Little Women
514,"deal to show, and by-and-by she saw, and was grateful for it.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""An old maid, that's what I'm to be.  A literary spinster, with a pen",Little Women
514,"for a spouse, a family of stories for children, and twenty years hence",Little Women
514,"a morsel of fame, perhaps, when, like poor Johnson, I'm old and can't",Little Women
514,"enjoy it, solitary, and can't share it, independent, and don't need it.",Little Women
514,"Well, I needn't be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner, and, I dare say,",Little Women
514,"old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it, but..."" and",Little Women
514,"there Jo sighed, as if the prospect was not inviting.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It seldom is, at first, and thirty seems the end of all things to",Little Women
514,"five-and-twenty.  But it's not as bad as it looks, and one can get on",Little Women
514,quite happily if one has something in one's self to fall back upon.  At,Little Women
514,"twenty-five, girls begin to talk about being old maids, but secretly",Little Women
514,"resolve that they never will be.  At thirty they say nothing about it,",Little Women
514,"but quietly accept the fact, and if sensible, console themselves by",Little Women
514,"remembering that they have twenty more useful, happy years, in which",Little Women
514,they may be learning to grow old gracefully.  Don't laugh at the,Little Women
514,"spinsters, dear girls, for often very tender, tragic romances are",Little Women
514,"hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns,",Little Women
514,"and many silent sacrifices of youth, health, ambition, love itself,",Little Women
514,"make the faded faces beautiful in God's sight.  Even the sad, sour",Little Women
514,"sisters should be kindly dealt with, because they have missed the",Little Women
514,"sweetest part of life, if for no other reason.  And looking at them",Little Women
514,"with compassion, not contempt, girls in their bloom should remember",Little Women
514,that they too may miss the blossom time.  That rosy cheeks don't last,Little Women
514,"forever, that silver threads will come in the bonnie brown hair, and",Little Women
514,"that, by-and-by, kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and",Little Women
514,admiration now.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Gentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids, no matter",Little Women
514,"how poor and plain and prim, for the only chivalry worth having is that",Little Women
514,"which is the readiest to pay deference to the old, protect the feeble,",Little Women
514,"and serve womankind, regardless of rank, age, or color.  Just recollect",Little Women
514,"the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed, but nursed and",Little Women
514,"petted, too often without thanks, the scrapes they have helped you out",Little Women
514,"of, the tips they have given you from their small store, the stitches",Little Women
514,"the patient old fingers have set for you, the steps the willing old",Little Women
514,"feet have taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little",Little Women
514,attentions that women love to receive as long as they live.  The,Little Women
514,"bright-eyed girls are quick to see such traits, and will like you all",Little Women

514,"irresistibly funny that I can't keep sober!"" answered Jo, smiling all",Little Women
514,"over her face, so infectiously that they had another laugh, and then",Little Women
514,"settled down for a good talk, quite in the pleasant old fashion.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's no use your going out in the cold to get Amy, for they are all",Little Women
514,coming up presently.  I couldn't wait.  I wanted to be the one to tell,Little Women
514,"you the grand surprise, and have 'first skim' as we used to say when we",Little Women
514,"squabbled about the cream.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Of course you did, and spoiled your story by beginning at the wrong",Little Women
514,"end.  Now, start right, and tell me how it all happened. I'm pining to",Little Women
514,"know.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, I did it to please Amy,"" began Laurie, with a twinkle that made",Little Women
514,Jo exclaim...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Fib number one.  Amy did it to please you.  Go on, and tell the truth,",Little Women
514,"if you can, sir.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Now she's beginning to marm it.  Isn't it jolly to hear her?"" said",Little Women
514,"Laurie to the fire, and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite",Little Women
514,"agreed.  ""It's all the same, you know, she and I being one. We planned",Little Women
514,"to come home with the Carrols, a month or more ago, but they suddenly",Little Women
514,"changed their minds, and decided to pass another winter in Paris.  But",Little Women
514,"Grandpa wanted to come home.  He went to please me, and I couldn't let",Little Women
514,"him go alone, neither could I leave Amy, and Mrs. Carrol had got",Little Women
514,"English notions about chaperons and such nonsense, and wouldn't let Amy",Little Women
514,"come with us.  So I just settled the difficulty by saying, 'Let's be",Little Women
514,"married, and then we can do as we like'.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Of course you did.  You always have things to suit you.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not always,"" and something in Laurie's voice made Jo say hastily...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""How did you ever get Aunt to agree?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It was hard work, but between us, we talked her over, for we had heaps",Little Women
514,"of good reasons on our side.  There wasn't time to write and ask leave,",Little Women
514,"but you all liked it, had consented to it by-and-by, and it was only",Little Women
514,"'taking time by the fetlock', as my wife says.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Aren't we proud of those two words, and don't we like to say them?""",Little Women
514,"interrupted Jo, addressing the fire in her turn, and watching with",Little Women
514,delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been,Little Women
514,so tragically gloomy when she saw them last.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""A trifle, perhaps, she's such a captivating little woman I can't help",Little Women
514,"being proud of her.  Well, then Uncle and Aunt were there to play",Little Women
514,propriety.  We were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use,Little Women
514,"apart, and that charming arrangement would make everything easy all",Little Women
514,"round, so we did it.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""When, where, how?"" asked Jo, in a fever of feminine interest and",Little Women
514,"curiosity, for she could not realize it a particle.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Six weeks ago, at the American consul's, in Paris, a very quiet",Little Women
514,"wedding of course, for even in our happiness we didn't forget dear",Little Women
514,"little Beth.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo put her hand in his as he said that, and Laurie gently smoothed the",Little Women
514,"little red pillow, which he remembered well.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Why didn't you let us know afterward?"" asked Jo, in a quieter tone,",Little Women
514,when they had sat quite still a minute.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""We wanted to surprise you.  We thought we were coming directly home,",Little Women
514,"at first, but the dear old gentleman, as soon as we were married, found",Little Women
514,"he couldn't be ready under a month, at least, and sent us off to spend",Little Women
514,our honeymoon wherever we liked. Amy had once called Valrosa a regular,Little Women
514,"honeymoon home, so we went there, and were as happy as people are but",Little Women
514,"once in their lives. My faith!  Wasn't it love among the roses!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Laurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute, and Jo was glad of it, for the",Little Women
514,fact that he told her these things so freely and so naturally assured,Little Women
514,her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten. She tried to draw away,Little Women
514,"her hand, but as if he guessed the thought that prompted the",Little Women
514,"half-involuntary impulse, Laurie held it fast, and said, with a manly",Little Women
514,gravity she had never seen in him before...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Jo, dear, I want to say one thing, and then we'll put it by forever.",Little Women
514,As I told you in my letter when I wrote that Amy had been so kind to,Little Women
514,"me, I never shall stop loving you, but the love is altered, and I have",Little Women
514,learned to see that it is better as it is. Amy and you changed places,Little Women
514,"in my heart, that's all.  I think it was meant to be so, and would have",Little Women
514,"come about naturally, if I had waited, as you tried to make me, but I",Little Women
514,"never could be patient, and so I got a heartache.  I was a boy then,",Little Women
514,"headstrong and violent, and it took a hard lesson to show me my",Little Women
514,"mistake.  For it was one, Jo, as you said, and I found it out, after",Little Women
514,"making a fool of myself. Upon my word, I was so tumbled up in my mind,",Little Women
514,"at one time, that I didn't know which I loved best, you or Amy, and",Little Women
514,"tried to love you both alike.  But I couldn't, and when I saw her in",Little Women
514,"Switzerland, everything seemed to clear up all at once.  You both got",Little Women
514,"into your right places, and I felt sure that it was well off with the",Little Women
514,"old love before it was on with the new, that I could honestly share my",Little Women
514,"heart between sister Jo and wife Amy, and love them dearly. Will you",Little Women
514,"believe it, and go back to the happy old times when we first knew one",Little Women
514,"another?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll believe it, with all my heart, but, Teddy, we never can be boy",Little Women
514,"and girl again.  The happy old times can't come back, and we mustn't",Little Women
514,"expect it.  We are man and woman now, with sober work to do, for",Little Women
514,"playtime is over, and we must give up frolicking.  I'm sure you feel",Little Women
514,"this.  I see the change in you, and you'll find it in me.  I shall miss",Little Women
514,"my boy, but I shall love the man as much, and admire him more, because",Little Women
514,he means to be what I hoped he would.  We can't be little playmates any,Little Women
514,"longer, but we will be brother and sister, to love and help one another",Little Women
514,"all our lives, won't we, Laurie?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He did not say a word, but took the hand she offered him, and laid his",Little Women
514,"face down on it for a minute, feeling that out of the grave of a boyish",Little Women
514,"passion, there had risen a beautiful, strong friendship to bless them",Little Women
514,"both.  Presently Jo said cheerfully, for she didn't want the coming",Little Women
514,"home to be a sad one, ""I can't make it true that you children are",Little Women
514,"really married and going to set up housekeeping. Why, it seems only",Little Women
514,"yesterday that I was buttoning Amy's pinafore, and pulling your hair",Little Women
514,"when you teased.  Mercy me, how time does fly!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""As one of the children is older than yourself, you needn't talk so",Little Women
514,like a grandma.  I flatter myself I'm a 'gentleman growed' as Peggotty,Little Women
514,"said of David, and when you see Amy, you'll find her rather a",Little Women
514,"precocious infant,"" said Laurie, looking amused at her maternal air.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You may be a little older in years, but I'm ever so much older in",Little Women
514,"feeling, Teddy.  Women always are, and this last year has been such a",Little Women
514,"hard one that I feel forty.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Poor Jo!  We left you to bear it alone, while we went pleasuring. You",Little Women
514,"are older.  Here's a line, and there's another.  Unless you smile, your",Little Women
514,"eyes look sad, and when I touched the cushion, just now, I found a tear",Little Women
514,"on it.  You've had a great deal to bear, and had to bear it all alone.",Little Women
514,"What a selfish beast I've been!"" and Laurie pulled his own hair, with a",Little Women
514,remorseful look.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"But Jo only turned over the traitorous pillow, and answered, in a tone",Little Women
514,"which she tried to make more cheerful, ""No, I had Father and Mother to",Little Women
514,"help me, and the dear babies to comfort me, and the thought that you",Little Women
514,"and Amy were safe and happy, to make the troubles here easier to bear.",Little Women
514,"I am lonely, sometimes, but I dare say it's good for me, and...""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You never shall be again,"" broke in Laurie, putting his arm about her,",Little Women
514,"as if to fence out every human ill.  ""Amy and I can't get on without",Little Women
514,"you, so you must come and teach 'the children' to keep house, and go",Little Women
514,"halves in everything, just as we used to do, and let us pet you, and",Little Women
514,"all be blissfully happy and friendly together.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""If I shouldn't be in the way, it would be very pleasant.  I begin to",Little Women
514,"feel quite young already, for somehow all my troubles seemed to fly",Little Women
514,"away when you came.  You always were a comfort, Teddy,"" and Jo leaned",Little Women
514,"her head on his shoulder, just as she did years ago, when Beth lay ill",Little Women
514,and Laurie told her to hold on to him.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He looked down at her, wondering if she remembered the time, but Jo was",Little Women
514,"smiling to herself, as if in truth her troubles had all vanished at his",Little Women
514,coming.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You are the same Jo still, dropping tears about one minute, and",Little Women
514,"laughing the next.  You look a little wicked now.  What is it, Grandma?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I was wondering how you and Amy get on together.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Like angels!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, of course, but which rules?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I don't mind telling you that she does now, at least I let her think",Little Women
514,"so, it pleases her, you know.  By-and-by we shall take turns, for",Little Women
514,"marriage, they say, halves one's rights and doubles one's duties.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You'll go on as you begin, and Amy will rule you all the days of your",Little Women
514,"life.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, she does it so imperceptibly that I don't think I shall mind",Little Women
514,"much.  She is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well.  In fact, I",Little Women
514,"rather like it, for she winds one round her finger as softly and",Little Women
514,"prettily as a skein of silk, and makes you feel as if she was doing you",Little Women
514,"a favor all the while.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That ever I should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying",Little Women
514,"it!"" cried Jo, with uplifted hands.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It was good to see Laurie square his shoulders, and smile with",Little Women
514,"masculine scorn at that insinuation, as he replied, with his ""high and",Little Women
514,"mighty"" air, ""Amy is too well-bred for that, and I am not the sort of",Little Women
514,man to submit to it.  My wife and I respect ourselves and one another,Little Women
514,"too much ever to tyrannize or quarrel.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo liked that, and thought the new dignity very becoming, but the boy",Little Women
514,"seemed changing very fast into the man, and regret mingled with her",Little Women
514,pleasure.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I am sure of that.  Amy and you never did quarrel as we used to. She",Little Women
514,"is the sun and I the wind, in the fable, and the sun managed the man",Little Women
514,"best, you remember.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""She can blow him up as well as shine on him,"" laughed Laurie. ""Such a",Little Women
514,lecture as I got at Nice!  I give you my word it was a deal worse than,Little Women
514,"any of your scoldings, a regular rouser.  I'll tell you all about it",Little Women
514,"sometime, she never will, because after telling me that she despised",Little Women
514,"and was ashamed of me, she lost her heart to the despicable party and",Little Women
514,"married the good-for-nothing.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What baseness!  Well, if she abuses you, come to me, and I'll defend",Little Women
514,"you.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I look as if I needed it, don't I?"" said Laurie, getting up and",Little Women
514,striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing to the,Little Women
514,"rapturous, as Amy's voice was heard calling, ""Where is she? Where's my",Little Women
514,"dear old Jo?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"In trooped the whole family, and everyone was hugged and kissed all",Little Women
514,"over again, and after several vain attempts, the three wanderers were",Little Women
514,"set down to be looked at and exulted over.  Mr. Laurence, hale and",Little Women
514,"hearty as ever, was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign",Little Women
514,"tour, for the crustiness seemed to be nearly gone, and the",Little Women
514,old-fashioned courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier,Little Women
514,"than ever.  It was good to see him beam at 'my children', as he called",Little Women
514,the young pair.  It was better still to see Amy pay him the daughterly,Little Women
514,"duty and affection which completely won his old heart, and best of all,",Little Women
514,"to watch Laurie revolve about the two, as if never tired of enjoying",Little Women
514,the pretty picture they made.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The minute she put her eyes upon Amy, Meg became conscious that her own",Little Women
514,"dress hadn't a Parisian air, that young Mrs. Moffat would be entirely",Little Women
514,"eclipsed by young Mrs. Laurence, and that 'her ladyship' was altogether",Little Women
514,"a most elegant and graceful woman.  Jo thought, as she watched the",Little Women
514,"pair, ""How well they look together!  I was right, and Laurie has found",Little Women
514,"the beautiful, accomplished girl who will become his home better than",Little Women
514,"clumsy old Jo, and be a pride, not a torment to him.""  Mrs. March and",Little Women
514,"her husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces, for they",Little Women
514,"saw that their youngest had done well, not only in worldly things, but",Little Women
514,"the better wealth of love, confidence, and happiness.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,For Amy's face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a,Little Women
514,"peaceful heart, her voice had a new tenderness in it, and the cool,",Little Women
514,"prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity, both womanly and",Little Women
514,"winning. No little affectations marred it, and the cordial sweetness of",Little Women
514,"her manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace, for",Little Women
514,it stamped her at once with the unmistakable sign of the true,Little Women
514,gentlewoman she had hoped to become.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Love has done much for our little girl,"" said her mother softly.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""She has had a good example before her all her life, my dear,"" Mr.",Little Women
514,"March whispered back, with a loving look at the worn face and gray head",Little Women
514,beside him.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her 'pitty aunty', but",Little Women
514,attached herself like a lap dog to the wonderful chatelaine full of,Little Women
514,delightful charms.  Demi paused to consider the new relationship before,Little Women
514,"he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe, which took",Little Women
514,the tempting form of a family of wooden bears from Berne. A flank,Little Women
514,"movement produced an unconditional surrender, however, for Laurie knew",Little Women
514,where to have him.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Young man, when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance you",Little Women
514,"hit me in the face.  Now I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman,"" and",Little Women
514,with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew,Little Women
514,in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted,Little Women
514,his boyish soul.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Blest if she ain't in silk from head to foot; ain't it a relishin'",Little Women
514,"sight to see her settin' there as fine as a fiddle, and hear folks",Little Women
514,"calling little Amy 'Mis.  Laurence!'"" muttered old Hannah, who could",Little Women
514,"not resist frequent ""peeks"" through the slide as she set the table in a",Little Women
514,most decidedly promiscuous manner.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Mercy on us, how they did talk! first one, then the other, then all",Little Women
514,burst out together--trying to tell the history of three years in half,Little Women
514,"an hour.  It was fortunate that tea was at hand, to produce a lull and",Little Women
514,provide refreshment--for they would have been hoarse and faint if they,Little Women
514,had gone on much longer.  Such a happy procession as filed away into,Little Women
514,the little dining room! Mr. March proudly escorted Mrs. Laurence.  Mrs.,Little Women
514,March as proudly leaned on the arm of 'my son'. The old gentleman took,Little Women
514,"Jo, with a whispered, ""You must be my girl now,"" and a glance at the",Little Women
514,"empty corner by the fire, that made Jo whisper back, ""I'll try to fill",Little Women
514,"her place, sir.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The twins pranced behind, feeling that the millennium was at hand, for",Little Women
514,everyone was so busy with the newcomers that they were left to revel at,Little Women
514,"their own sweet will, and you may be sure they made the most of the",Little Women
514,"opportunity.  Didn't they steal sips of tea, stuff gingerbread ad",Little Women
514,"libitum, get a hot biscuit apiece, and as a crowning trespass, didn't",Little Women
514,"they each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets,",Little Women
514,"there to stick and crumble treacherously, teaching them that both human",Little Women
514,nature and a pastry are frail? Burdened with the guilty consciousness,Little Women
514,"of the sequestered tarts, and fearing that Dodo's sharp eyes would",Little Women
514,"pierce the thin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty,",Little Women
514,"the little sinners attached themselves to 'Dranpa', who hadn't his",Little Women
514,"spectacles on.  Amy, who was handed about like refreshments, returned",Little Women
514,to the parlor on Father Laurence's arm.  The others paired off as,Little Women
514,"before, and this arrangement left Jo companionless.  She did not mind",Little Women
514,"it at the minute, for she lingered to answer Hannah's eager inquiry.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Will Miss Amy ride in her coop (coupe), and use all them lovely silver",Little Women
514,"dishes that's stored away over yander?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Shouldn't wonder if she drove six white horses, ate off gold plate,",Little Women
514,and wore diamonds and point lace every day.  Teddy thinks nothing too,Little Women
514,"good for her,"" returned Jo with infinite satisfaction.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No more there is!  Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?""",Little Women
514,"asked Hannah, who wisely mingled poetry and prose.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I don't care,"" and Jo shut the door, feeling that food was an",Little Women
514,uncongenial topic just then.  She stood a minute looking at the party,Little Women
514,"vanishing above, and as Demi's short plaid legs toiled up the last",Little Women
514,"stair, a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly that she",Little Women
514,"looked about her with dim eyes, as if to find something to lean upon,",Little Women
514,for even Teddy had deserted her.  If she had known what birthday gift,Little Women
514,"was coming every minute nearer and nearer, she would not have said to",Little Women
514,"herself, ""I'll weep a little weep when I go to bed. It won't do to be",Little Women
514,"dismal now.""  Then she drew her hand over her eyes, for one of her",Little Women
514,"boyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was, and had",Little Women
514,just managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the porch,Little Women
514,door.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She opened with hospitable haste, and started as if another ghost had",Little Women
514,"come to surprise her, for there stood a tall bearded gentleman, beaming",Little Women
514,on her from the darkness like a midnight sun.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, Mr. Bhaer, I am so glad to see you!"" cried Jo, with a clutch, as",Little Women
514,if she feared the night would swallow him up before she could get him,Little Women
514,in.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""And I to see Miss Marsch, but no, you haf a party,"" and the Professor",Little Women
514,paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to,Little Women
514,them.,Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Though a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone decorously",Little Women
514,"away, and come again another day, but how could he, when Jo shut the",Little Women
514,"door behind him, and bereft him of his hat? Perhaps her face had",Little Women
514,"something to do with it, for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him,",Little Women
514,and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary,Little Women
514,"man, whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""If I shall not be Monsieur de Trop, I will so gladly see them all.",Little Women
514,"You haf been ill, my friend?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He put the question abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his coat, the light",Little Women
514,"fell on her face, and he saw a change in it.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Not ill, but tired and sorrowful.  We have had trouble since I saw you",Little Women
514,"last.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Ah, yes, I know.  My heart was sore for you when I heard that,"" and he",Little Women
514,"shook hands again, with such a sympathetic face that Jo felt as if no",Little Women
514,"comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes, the grasp of the big,",Little Women
514,warm hand.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Father, Mother, this is my friend, Professor Bhaer,"" she said, with a",Little Women
514,face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might,Little Women
514,as well have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"If the stranger had any doubts about his reception, they were set at",Little Women
514,rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received. Everyone greeted,Little Women
514,"him kindly, for Jo's sake at first, but very soon they liked him for",Little Women
514,"his own.  They could not help it, for he carried the talisman that",Little Women
514,"opens all hearts, and these simple people warmed to him at once,",Little Women
514,feeling even the more friendly because he was poor.  For poverty,Little Women
514,"enriches those who live above it, and is a sure passport to truly",Little Women
514,hospitable spirits.  Mr. Bhaer sat looking about him with the air of a,Little Women
514,"traveler who knocks at a strange door, and when it opens, finds himself",Little Women
514,"at home.  The children went to him like bees to a honeypot, and",Little Women
514,"establishing themselves on each knee, proceeded to captivate him by",Little Women
514,"rifling his pockets, pulling his beard, and investigating his watch,",Little Women
514,with juvenile audacity.  The women telegraphed their approval to one,Little Women
514,"another, and Mr. March, feeling that he had got a kindred spirit,",Little Women
514,"opened his choicest stores for his guest's benefit, while silent John",Little Women
514,"listened and enjoyed the talk, but said not a word, and Mr. Laurence",Little Women
514,found it impossible to go to sleep.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"If Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie's behavior would have",Little Women
514,"amused her, for a faint twinge, not of jealousy, but something like",Little Women
514,"suspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first, and observe",Little Women
514,the newcomer with brotherly circumspection. But it did not last long.,Little Women
514,"He got interested in spite of himself, and before he knew it, was drawn",Little Women
514,"into the circle.  For Mr. Bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere,",Little Women
514,"and did himself justice. He seldom spoke to Laurie, but he looked at",Little Women
514,"him often, and a shadow would pass across his face, as if regretting",Little Women
514,"his own lost youth, as he watched the young man in his prime.  Then his",Little Women
514,eyes would turn to Jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered,Little Women
514,the mute inquiry if she had seen it.  But Jo had her own eyes to take,Little Women
514,"care of, and feeling that they could not be trusted, she prudently kept",Little Women
514,"them on the little sock she was knitting, like a model maiden aunt.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,A stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water,Little Women
514,"after a dusty walk, for the sidelong peeps showed her several",Little Women
514,propitious omens.  Mr. Bhaer's face had lost the absent-minded,Little Women
514,"expression, and looked all alive with interest in the present moment,",Little Women
514,"actually young and handsome, she thought, forgetting to compare him",Little Women
514,"with Laurie, as she usually did strange men, to their great detriment.",Little Women
514,"Then he seemed quite inspired, though the burial customs of the",Little Women
514,"ancients, to which the conversation had strayed, might not be",Little Women
514,considered an exhilarating topic. Jo quite glowed with triumph when,Little Women
514,"Teddy got quenched in an argument, and thought to herself, as she",Little Women
514,"watched her father's absorbed face, ""How he would enjoy having such a",Little Women
514,"man as my Professor to talk with every day!""  Lastly, Mr. Bhaer was",Little Women
514,"dressed in a new suit of black, which made him look more like a",Little Women
514,"gentleman than ever.  His bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed,",Little Women
514,"but didn't stay in order long, for in exciting moments, he rumpled it",Little Women
514,"up in the droll way he used to do, and Jo liked it rampantly erect",Little Women
514,"better than flat, because she thought it gave his fine forehead a",Little Women
514,"Jove-like aspect.  Poor Jo, how she did glorify that plain man, as she",Little Women
514,"sat knitting away so quietly, yet letting nothing escape her, not even",Little Women
514,the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold sleeve-buttons in his,Little Women
514,immaculate wristbands.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Dear old fellow!  He couldn't have got himself up with more care if",Little Women
514,"he'd been going a-wooing,"" said Jo to herself, and then a sudden",Little Women
514,thought born of the words made her blush so dreadfully that she had to,Little Women
514,"drop her ball, and go down after it to hide her face.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected, however, for",Little Women
514,"though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral pyre, the Professor",Little Women
514,"dropped his torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a dive after the",Little Women
514,"little blue ball.  Of course they bumped their heads smartly together,",Little Women
514,"saw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to",Little Women
514,"resume their seats, wishing they had not left them.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Nobody knew where the evening went to, for Hannah skillfully abstracted",Little Women
514,"the babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy poppies, and Mr.",Little Women
514,"Laurence went home to rest.  The others sat round the fire, talking",Little Women
514,"away, utterly regardless of the lapse of time, till Meg, whose maternal",Little Women
514,mind was impressed with a firm conviction that Daisy had tumbled out of,Little Women
514,"bed, and Demi set his nightgown afire studying the structure of",Little Women
514,"matches, made a move to go.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all together",Little Women
514,"again once more,"" said Jo, feeling that a good shout would be a safe",Little Women
514,and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,They were not all there.  But no one found the words thoughtless or,Little Women
514,"untrue, for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence,",Little Women
514,"invisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break the",Little Women
514,household league that love made dissoluble.  The little chair stood in,Little Women
514,"its old place.  The tidy basket, with the bit of work she left",Little Women
514,"unfinished when the needle grew 'so heavy', was still on its accustomed",Little Women
514,"shelf.  The beloved instrument, seldom touched now had not been moved,",Little Women
514,"and above it Beth's face, serene and smiling, as in the early days,",Little Women
514,"looked down upon them, seeming to say, ""Be happy.  I am here.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Play something, Amy.  Let them hear how much you have improved,"" said",Little Women
514,"Laurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"But Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded stool, ""Not",Little Women
514,"tonight, dear.  I can't show off tonight.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"But she did show something better than brilliancy or skill, for she",Little Women
514,sang Beth's songs with a tender music in her voice which the best,Little Women
514,"master could not have taught, and touched the listener's hearts with a",Little Women
514,sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her.  The,Little Women
514,"room was very still, when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last",Little Women
514,line of Beth's favorite hymn.  It was hard to say...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,    Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"and Amy leaned against her husband, who stood behind her, feeling that",Little Women
514,her welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth's kiss.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Now, we must finish with Mignon's song, for Mr. Bhaer sings that,""",Little Women
514,"said Jo, before the pause grew painful.  And Mr. Bhaer cleared his",Little Women
514,"throat with a gratified ""Hem!"" as he stepped into the corner where Jo",Little Women
514,"stood, saying...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You will sing with me?  We go excellently well together.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"A pleasing fiction, by the way, for Jo had no more idea of music than a",Little Women
514,grasshopper.  But she would have consented if he had proposed to sing a,Little Women
514,"whole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless of time and tune.",Little Women
514,"It didn't much matter, for Mr. Bhaer sang like a true German, heartily",Little Women
514,"and well, and Jo soon subsided into a subdued hum, that she might",Little Women
514,listen to the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her alone.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"    Know'st thou the land where the citron blooms,",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"used to be the Professor's favorite line, for 'das land' meant Germany",Little Women
514,"to him, but now he seemed to dwell, with peculiar warmth and melody,",Little Women
514,upon the words...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"    There, oh there, might I with thee,",Little Women
514,"    O, my beloved, go",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she,Little Women
514,"longed to say she did know the land, and would joyfully depart thither",Little Women
514,whenever he liked.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"The song was considered a great success, and the singer retired covered",Little Women
514,"with laurels.  But a few minutes afterward, he forgot his manners",Little Women
514,"entirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet, for she had been",Little Women
514,"introduced simply as 'my sister', and no one had called her by her new",Little Women
514,"name since he came.  He forgot himself still further when Laurie said,",Little Women
514,"in his most gracious manner, at parting...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir.  Please remember that",Little Women
514,"there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Then the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so suddenly",Little Women
514,"illuminated with satisfaction, that Laurie thought him the most",Little Women
514,delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I too shall go, but I shall gladly come again, if you will gif me",Little Women
514,"leave, dear madame, for a little business in the city will keep me here",Little Women
514,"some days.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He spoke to Mrs. March, but he looked at Jo, and the mother's voice",Little Women
514,"gave as cordial an assent as did the daughter's eyes, for Mrs. March",Little Women
514,was not so blind to her children's interest as Mrs. Moffat supposed.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I suspect that is a wise man,"" remarked Mr. March, with placid",Little Women
514,"satisfaction, from the hearthrug, after the last guest had gone.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I know he is a good one,"" added Mrs. March, with decided approval, as",Little Women

514,"""I thought you'd like him,"" was all Jo said, as she slipped away to her",Little Women
514,bed.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"She wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the city,",Little Women
514,"and finally decided that he had been appointed to some great honor,",Little Women
514,"somewhere, but had been too modest to mention the fact.  If she had",Little Women
514,"seen his face when, safe in his own room, he looked at the picture of a",Little Women
514,"severe and rigid young lady, with a good deal of hair, who appeared to",Little Women
514,"be gazing darkly into futurity, it might have thrown some light upon",Little Women

514,"""Certainly not, though you do hear charming girls say that they intend",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Ah, we'll do quantities of good, won't we?  There's one sort of",Little Women

514,"ask, and people don't dare to offer charity. Yet there are a thousand",Little Women
514,"ways of helping them, if one only knows how to do it so delicately that",Little Women

514,"full of courage, patience, and ambition that I was ashamed of myself,",Little Women
514,and longed to give them a right good lift.  Those are people whom it's,Little Women
514,"a satisfaction to help, for if they've got genius, it's an honor to be",Little Women
514,"allowed to serve them, and not let it be lost or delayed for want of",Little Women

514,"family, without devoting at least one chapter to the two most precious",Little Women
514,and important members of it.  Daisy and Demi had now arrived at years,Little Women
514,"of discretion, for in this fast age babies of three or four assert",Little Women
514,"their rights, and get them, too, which is more than many of their",Little Women
514,elders do.  If there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being,Little Women
514,"utterly spoiled by adoration, it was these prattling Brookes.  Of",Little Women
514,"course they were the most remarkable children ever born, as will be",Little Women
514,"shown when I mention that they walked at eight months, talked fluently",Little Women
514,"at twelve months, and at two years they took their places at table, and",Little Women
514,"behaved with a propriety which charmed all beholders. At three, Daisy",Little Women
514,"demanded a 'needler', and actually made a bag with four stitches in it.",Little Women
514,"She likewise set up housekeeping in the sideboard, and managed a",Little Women
514,microscopic cooking stove with a skill that brought tears of pride to,Little Women
514,"Hannah's eyes, while Demi learned his letters with his grandfather, who",Little Women
514,invented a new mode of teaching the alphabet by forming letters with,Little Women
514,"his arms and legs, thus uniting gymnastics for head and heels.  The boy",Little Women
514,early developed a mechanical genius which delighted his father and,Little Women
514,"distracted his mother, for he tried to imitate every machine he saw,",Little Women
514,"and kept the nursery in a chaotic condition, with his 'sewinsheen', a",Little Women
514,"mysterious structure of string, chairs, clothespins, and spools, for",Little Women
514,wheels to go 'wound and wound'.  Also a basket hung over the back of a,Little Women
514,"chair, in which he vainly tried to hoist his too confiding sister, who,",Little Women
514,"with feminine devotion, allowed her little head to be bumped till",Little Women
514,"rescued, when the young inventor indignantly remarked, ""Why, Marmar,",Little Women
514,"dat's my lellywaiter, and me's trying to pull her up.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Though utterly unlike in character, the twins got on remarkably well",Little Women
514,"together, and seldom quarreled more than thrice a day.  Of course, Demi",Little Women
514,"tyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly defended her from every other",Little Women
514,"aggressor, while Daisy made a galley slave of herself, and adored her",Little Women
514,"brother as the one perfect being in the world.  A rosy, chubby,",Little Women
514,"sunshiny little soul was Daisy, who found her way to everybody's heart,",Little Women
514,"and nestled there.  One of the captivating children, who seem made to",Little Women
514,"be kissed and cuddled, adorned and adored like little goddesses, and",Little Women
514,produced for general approval on all festive occasions. Her small,Little Women
514,virtues were so sweet that she would have been quite angelic if a few,Little Women
514,small naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully human.  It was all,Little Women
514,"fair weather in her world, and every morning she scrambled up to the",Little Women
514,"window in her little nightgown to look out, and say, no matter whether",Little Women
514,"it rained or shone, ""Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty day!"" Everyone was a",Little Women
514,"friend, and she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the",Little Women
514,"most inveterate bachelor relented, and baby-lovers became faithful",Little Women
514,worshipers.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Me loves evvybody,"" she once said, opening her arms, with her spoon in",Little Women
514,"one hand, and her mug in the other, as if eager to embrace and nourish",Little Women
514,the whole world.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As she grew, her mother began to feel that the Dovecote would be",Little Women
514,blessed by the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that which,Little Women
514,"had helped to make the old house home, and to pray that she might be",Little Women
514,spared a loss like that which had lately taught them how long they had,Little Women
514,entertained an angel unawares.  Her grandfather often called her,Little Women
514,"'Beth', and her grandmother watched over her with untiring devotion, as",Little Women
514,"if trying to atone for some past mistake, which no eye but her own",Little Women
514,could see.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Demi, like a true Yankee, was of an inquiring turn, wanting to know",Little Women
514,"everything, and often getting much disturbed because he could not get",Little Women
514,"satisfactory answers to his perpetual ""What for?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"He also possessed a philosophic bent, to the great delight of his",Little Women
514,"grandfather, who used to hold Socratic conversations with him, in which",Little Women
514,"the precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher, to the undisguised",Little Women
514,satisfaction of the womenfolk.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What makes my legs go, Dranpa?"" asked the young philosopher, surveying",Little Women
514,"those active portions of his frame with a meditative air, while resting",Little Women
514,after a go-to-bed frolic one night.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's your little mind, Demi,"" replied the sage, stroking the yellow",Little Women

514,"""Does I?"" and Demi's brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, but I can't show you how, for it is done when we don't see.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women

514,"and then gravely remarked, ""I dess Dod does it when I's asleep.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"A careful explanation followed, to which he listened so attentively",Little Women
514,"that his anxious grandmother said, ""My dear, do you think it wise to",Little Women

514,and I have no doubt the boy understands every word I have said to him.,Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"If the boy had replied like Alcibiades, ""By the gods, Socrates, I",Little Women
514,"cannot tell,"" his grandfather would not have been surprised, but when,",Little Women
514,"after standing a moment on one leg, like a meditative young stork, he",Little Women

514,"Aunt Dodo was chief playmate and confidante of both children, and the",Little Women

514,"Aunt Dodo was a living reality, and they made the most of her, for",Little Women
514,"which compliment she was deeply grateful.  But when Mr. Bhaer came, Jo",Little Women
514,"neglected her playfellows, and dismay and desolation fell upon their",Little Women
514,"little souls.  Daisy, who was fond of going about peddling kisses, lost",Little Women
514,"her best customer and became bankrupt.  Demi, with infantile",Little Women
514,"penetration, soon discovered that Dodo like to play with 'the bear-man'",Little Women
514,"better than she did him, but though hurt, he concealed his anguish, for",Little Women
514,he hadn't the heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate,Little Women

514,its case and freely shaken by ardent admirers.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as bribes,",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,Gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the,Little Women
514,"young relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard, but this",Little Women
514,"counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them, and does not",Little Women
514,"deceive anybody a particle.  Mr. Bhaer's devotion was sincere, however",Little Women
514,likewise effective--for honesty is the best policy in love as in law.,Little Women
514,"He was one of the men who are at home with children, and looked",Little Women
514,particularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his,Little Women
514,"manly one.  His business, whatever it was, detained him from day to",Little Women
514,"day, but evening seldom failed to bring him out to see--well, he always",Little Women
514,"asked for Mr. March, so I suppose he was the attraction.  The excellent",Little Women
514,"papa labored under the delusion that he was, and reveled in long",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"Mr. Bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study,",Little Women
514,astonished by the spectacle that met his eye.  Prone upon the floor lay,Little Women
514,"Mr. March, with his respectable legs in the air, and beside him,",Little Women
514,"likewise prone, was Demi, trying to imitate the attitude with his own",Little Women
514,"short, scarlet-stockinged legs, both grovelers so seriously absorbed",Little Women
514,"that they were unconscious of spectators, till Mr. Bhaer laughed his",Little Women

514,"away arm in arm with her Professor, feeling as if the sun had suddenly",Little Women
514,"burst out with uncommon brilliancy, that the world was all right again,",Little Women
514,and that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling through the wet that,Little Women
514,day.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""We thought you had gone,"" said Jo hastily, for she knew he was looking",Little Women
514,"at her.  Her bonnet wasn't big enough to hide her face, and she feared",Little Women
514,he might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those who haf",Little Women
514,"been so heavenly kind to me?"" he asked so reproachfully that she felt",Little Women
514,"as if she had insulted him by the suggestion, and answered heartily...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, I didn't.  I knew you were busy about your own affairs, but we",Little Women

514,"""I'm always glad to see you, sir.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"In her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm, Jo made it rather cool,",Little Women
514,and the frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill the,Little Women
514,"Professor, for his smile vanished, as he said gravely...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I thank you, and come one more time before I go.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You are going, then?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I haf no longer any business here, it is done.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Successfully, I hope?"" said Jo, for the bitterness of disappointment",Little Women
514,was in that short reply of his.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I ought to think so, for I haf a way opened to me by which I can make",Little Women
514,"my bread and gif my Junglings much help.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Tell me, please!  I like to know all about the--the boys,"" said Jo",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""That is so kind, I gladly tell you.  My friends find for me a place in",Little Women

514,"not?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Indeed you should.  How splendid it will be to have you doing what you",Little Women
514,"like, and be able to see you often, and the boys!"" cried Jo, clinging",Little Women
514,to the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction she could not help,Little Women
514,betraying.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Ah!  But we shall not meet often, I fear, this place is at the West.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""So far away!"" and Jo left her skirts to their fate, as if it didn't",Little Women
514,matter now what became of her clothes or herself.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Mr. Bhaer could read several languages, but he had not learned to read",Little Women
514,"women yet.  He flattered himself that he knew Jo pretty well, and was,",Little Women
514,"therefore, much amazed by the contradictions of voice, face, and",Little Women
514,"manner, which she showed him in rapid succession that day, for she was",Little Women
514,in half a dozen different moods in the course of half an hour.  When,Little Women
514,"she met him she looked surprised, though it was impossible to help",Little Women
514,suspecting that she had come for that express purpose.  When he offered,Little Women
514,"her his arm, she took it with a look that filled him with delight, but",Little Women
514,"when he asked if she missed him, she gave such a chilly, formal reply",Little Women
514,that despair fell upon him.  On learning his good fortune she almost,Little Women
514,clapped her hands.  Was the joy all for the boys? Then on hearing his,Little Women
514,"destination, she said, ""So far away!"" in a tone of despair that lifted",Little Women
514,"him on to a pinnacle of hope, but the next minute she tumbled him down",Little Women
514,"again by observing, like one entirely absorbed in the matter...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Here's the place for my errands.  Will you come in? It won't take",Little Women
514,"long.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities, and",Little Women
514,particularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and,Little Women
514,dispatch with which she would accomplish the business. But owing to the,Little Women
514,"flutter she was in, everything went amiss. She upset the tray of",Little Women
514,"needles, forgot the silesia was to be 'twilled' till it was cut off,",Little Women
514,"gave the wrong change, and covered herself with confusion by asking for",Little Women
514,"lavender ribbon at the calico counter.  Mr. Bhaer stood by, watching",Little Women
514,"her blush and blunder, and as he watched, his own bewilderment seemed",Little Women
514,"to subside, for he was beginning to see that on some occasions, women,",Little Women
514,"like dreams, go by contraries.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"When they came out, he put the parcel under his arm with a more",Little Women
514,"cheerful aspect, and splashed through the puddles as if he rather",Little Women
514,enjoyed it on the whole.,Little Women

514,"""Should we no do a little what you call shopping for the babies, and",Little Women

514,flowers.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What will we buy?"" asked Jo, ignoring the latter part of his speech,",Little Women
514,and sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation of delight as they,Little Women
514,went in.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""May they haf oranges and figs?"" asked Mr. Bhaer, with a paternal air.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""They eat them when they can get them.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Do you care for nuts?""",Little Women

514,"""Hamburg grapes.  Yes, we shall drink to the Fatherland in those?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance, and asked why he didn't buy",Little Women
514,"a frail of dates, a cask of raisins, and a bag of almonds, and be done",Little Women
514,"with it?  Whereat Mr. Bhaer confiscated her purse, produced his own,",Little Women
514,"and finished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes, a pot of",Little Women
514,"rosy daisies, and a pretty jar of honey, to be regarded in the light of",Little Women
514,"a demijohn.  Then distorting his pockets with knobby bundles, and",Little Women
514,"giving her the flowers to hold, he put up the old umbrella, and they",Little Women
514,traveled on again.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Miss Marsch, I haf a great favor to ask of you,"" began the Professor,",Little Women
514,after a moist promenade of half a block.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, sir?"" and Jo's heart began to beat so hard she was afraid he",Little Women
514,would hear it.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I am bold to say it in spite of the rain, because so short a time",Little Women
514,"remains to me.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, sir,"" and Jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with the sudden",Little Women
514,squeeze she gave it.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I wish to get a little dress for my Tina, and I am too stupid to go",Little Women
514,"alone.  Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, sir,"" and Jo felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if she had",Little Women
514,stepped into a refrigerator.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Perhaps also a shawl for Tina's mother, she is so poor and sick, and",Little Women
514,"the husband is such a care.  Yes, yes, a thick, warm shawl would be a",Little Women
514,"friendly thing to take the little mother.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll do it with pleasure, Mr. Bhaer.""  ""I'm going very fast, and he's",Little Women
514,"getting dearer every minute,"" added Jo to herself, then with a mental",Little Women
514,shake she entered into the business with an energy that was pleasant to,Little Women
514,behold.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Mr. Bhaer left it all to her, so she chose a pretty gown for Tina, and",Little Women
514,"then ordered out the shawls.  The clerk, being a married man,",Little Women
514,"condescended to take an interest in the couple, who appeared to be",Little Women
514,shopping for their family.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Your lady may prefer this.  It's a superior article, a most desirable",Little Women
514,"color, quite chaste and genteel,"" he said, shaking out a comfortable",Little Women
514,"gray shawl, and throwing it over Jo's shoulders.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Does this suit you, Mr. Bhaer?"" she asked, turning her back to him,",Little Women
514,and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her face.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Excellently well, we will haf it,"" answered the Professor, smiling to",Little Women
514,"himself as he paid for it, while Jo continued to rummage the counters",Little Women
514,like a confirmed bargain-hunter.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Now shall we go home?"" he asked, as if the words were very pleasant to",Little Women
514,him.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, it's late, and I'm _so_ tired."" Jo's voice was more pathetic than",Little Women
514,she knew.  For now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it,Little Women
514,"came out, and the world grew muddy and miserable again, and for the",Little Women
514,"first time she discovered that her feet were cold, her head ached, and",Little Women
514,"that her heart was colder than the former, fuller of pain than the",Little Women
514,"latter.  Mr. Bhaer was going away, he only cared for her as a friend,",Little Women
514,"it was all a mistake, and the sooner it was over the better.  With this",Little Women
514,"idea in her head, she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty",Little Women
514,gesture that the daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""This is not our omniboos,"" said the Professor, waving the loaded",Little Women
514,"vehicle away, and stopping to pick up the poor little flowers.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I beg your pardon.  I didn't see the name distinctly.  Never mind, I",Little Women
514,"can walk.  I'm used to plodding in the mud,"" returned Jo, winking hard,",Little Women
514,because she would have died rather than openly wipe her eyes.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Mr. Bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks, though she turned her head away.",Little Women
514,"The sight seemed to touch him very much, for suddenly stooping down, he",Little Women
514,"asked in a tone that meant a great deal, ""Heart's dearest, why do you",Little Women
514,"cry?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Now, if Jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have said",Little Women
514,"she wasn't crying, had a cold in her head, or told any other feminine",Little Women
514,"fib proper to the occasion.  Instead of which, that undignified",Little Women
514,"creature answered, with an irrepressible sob, ""Because you are going",Little Women
514,"away.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Ach, mein Gott, that is so good!"" cried Mr. Bhaer, managing to clasp",Little Women
514,"his hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles, ""Jo, I haf nothing",Little Women
514,"but much love to gif you.  I came to see if you could care for it, and",Little Women
514,I waited to be sure that I was something more than a friend.  Am I?,Little Women
514,"Can you make a little place in your heart for old Fritz?"" he added, all",Little Women
514,in one breath.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Oh, yes!"" said Jo, and he was quite satisfied, for she folded both",Little Women
514,"hands over his arm, and looked up at him with an expression that",Little Women
514,"plainly showed how happy she would be to walk through life beside him,",Little Women
514,"even though she had no better shelter than the old umbrella, if he",Little Women
514,carried it.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It was certainly proposing under difficulties, for even if he had",Little Women
514,"desired to do so, Mr. Bhaer could not go down upon his knees, on",Little Women
514,"account of the mud.  Neither could he offer Jo his hand, except",Little Women
514,"figuratively, for both were full.  Much less could he indulge in tender",Little Women
514,"remonstrations in the open street, though he was near it.  So the only",Little Women
514,"way in which he could express his rapture was to look at her, with an",Little Women
514,expression which glorified his face to such a degree that there,Little Women
514,actually seemed to be little rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his,Little Women
514,"beard.  If he had not loved Jo very much, I don't think he could have",Little Women
514,"done it then, for she looked far from lovely, with her skirts in a",Little Women
514,"deplorable state, her rubber boots splashed to the ankle, and her",Little Women
514,"bonnet a ruin.  Fortunately, Mr. Bhaer considered her the most",Little Women
514,"beautiful woman living, and she found him more ""Jove-like"" than ever,",Little Women
514,though his hatbrim was quite limp with the little rills trickling,Little Women
514,"thence upon his shoulders (for he held the umbrella all over Jo), and",Little Women
514,every finger of his gloves needed mending.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Passers-by probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics, for they",Little Women
514,"entirely forgot to hail a bus, and strolled leisurely along, oblivious",Little Women
514,"of deepening dusk and fog.  Little they cared what anybody thought, for",Little Women
514,they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any,Little Women
514,"life, the magical moment which bestows youth on the old, beauty on the",Little Women
514,"plain, wealth on the poor, and gives human hearts a foretaste of",Little Women
514,"heaven. The Professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom, and the",Little Women
514,world had nothing more to offer him in the way of bliss.  While Jo,Little Women
514,"trudged beside him, feeling as if her place had always been there, and",Little Women
514,"wondering how she ever could have chosen any other lot.  Of course, she",Little Women
514,"was the first to speak--intelligibly, I mean, for the emotional remarks",Little Women
514,"which followed her impetuous ""Oh, yes!"" were not of a coherent or",Little Women
514,reportable character.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Friedrich, why didn't you...""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Ah, heaven, she gifs me the name that no one speaks since Minna died!""",Little Women

514,delight.,Little Women

514,"keep ourselves young mit it.  Your English 'you' is so cold, say",Little Women

514,more like a romantic student than a grave professor.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Well, then, why didn't thou tell me all this sooner?"" asked Jo",Little Women
514,bashfully.,Little Women

514,"because thou must take care of it hereafter.  See, then, my Jo--ah, the",Little Women

514,"goodbye in New York, but I thought the handsome friend was betrothed to",Little Women
514,"thee, and so I spoke not.  Wouldst thou have said 'Yes', then, if I had",Little Women

514,"""Let it go, it has done its duty, and I will haf a fresh one when I",Little Women
514,"read all the brown book in which she keeps her little secrets,"" said",Little Women
514,Mr. Bhaer with a smile as he watched the fragments fly away on the,Little Women
514,"wind.  ""Yes,"" he added earnestly, ""I read that, and I think to myself,",Little Women
514,"She has a sorrow, she is lonely, she would find comfort in true love.",Little Women
514,"I haf a heart full, full for her.  Shall I not go and say, 'If this is",Little Women

514,"in Gott's name?'""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""And so you came to find that it was not too poor, but the one precious",Little Women

514,,Little Women
514,"""I had no courage to think that at first, heavenly kind as was your",Little Women
514,"welcome to me.  But soon I began to hope, and then I said, 'I will haf",Little Women
514,"her if I die for it,' and so I will!"" cried Mr. Bhaer, with a defiant",Little Women
514,"nod, as if the walls of mist closing round them were barriers which he",Little Women
514,was to surmount or valiantly knock down.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo thought that was splendid, and resolved to be worthy of her knight,",Little Women
514,though he did not come prancing on a charger in gorgeous array.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""What made you stay away so long?"" she asked presently, finding it so",Little Women
514,pleasant to ask confidential questions and get delightful answers that,Little Women
514,she could not keep silent.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It was not easy, but I could not find the heart to take you from that",Little Women
514,"so happy home until I could haf a prospect of one to gif you, after",Little Women
514,"much time, perhaps, and hard work.  How could I ask you to gif up so",Little Women
514,"much for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but a little learning?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'm glad you are poor.  I couldn't bear a rich husband,"" said Jo",Little Women
514,"decidedly, adding in a softer tone, ""Don't fear poverty. I've known it",Little Women
514,"long enough to lose my dread and be happy working for those I love, and",Little Women
514,don't call yourself old--forty is the prime of life.  I couldn't help,Little Women
514,"loving you if you were seventy!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,The Professor found that so touching that he would have been glad of,Little Women
514,"his handkerchief, if he could have got at it.  As he couldn't, Jo wiped",Little Women
514,"his eyes for him, and said, laughing, as she took away a bundle or",Little Women
514,two...,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I may be strong-minded, but no one can say I'm out of my sphere now,",Little Women

514,"burdens.  I'm to carry my share, Friedrich, and help to earn the home.",Little Women
514,"Make up your mind to that, or I'll never go,"" she added resolutely, as",Little Women
514,he tried to reclaim his load.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""We shall see.  Haf you patience to wait a long time, Jo? I must go",Little Women
514,"away and do my work alone.  I must help my boys first, because, even",Little Women
514,"for you, I may not break my word to Minna.  Can you forgif that, and be",Little Women
514,"happy while we hope and wait?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, I know I can, for we love one another, and that makes all the",Little Women

514,"myself if I neglected them even for you, so there's no need of hurry or",Little Women
514,"impatience.  You can do your part out West, I can do mine here, and",Little Women

514,quite overcome.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo never, never would learn to be proper, for when he said that as they",Little Women
514,"stood upon the steps, she just put both hands into his, whispering",Little Women
514,"tenderly, ""Not empty now,"" and stooping down, kissed her Friedrich",Little Women
514,"under the umbrella.  It was dreadful, but she would have done it if the",Little Women
514,"flock of draggle-tailed sparrows on the hedge had been human beings,",Little Women
514,"for she was very far gone indeed, and quite regardless of everything",Little Women
514,"but her own happiness. Though it came in such a very simple guise, that",Little Women
514,"was the crowning moment of both their lives, when, turning from the",Little Women
514,night and storm and loneliness to the household light and warmth and,Little Women
514,"peace waiting to receive them, with a glad ""Welcome home!""  Jo led her",Little Women

514,HARVEST TIME,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"For a year Jo and her Professor worked and waited, hoped and loved, met",Little Women
514,"occasionally, and wrote such voluminous letters that the rise in the",Little Women
514,"price of paper was accounted for, Laurie said.  The second year began",Little Women
514,"rather soberly, for their prospects did not brighten, and Aunt March",Little Women
514,died suddenly.  But when their first sorrow was over--for they loved,Little Women
514,the old lady in spite of her sharp tongue--they found they had cause,Little Women
514,"for rejoicing, for she had left Plumfield to Jo, which made all sorts",Little Women
514,of joyful things possible.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It's a fine old place, and will bring a handsome sum, for of course",Little Women
514,"you intend to sell it,"" said Laurie, as they were all talking the",Little Women
514,matter over some weeks later.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""No, I don't,"" was Jo's decided answer, as she petted the fat poodle,",Little Women
514,"whom she had adopted, out of respect to his former mistress.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""You don't mean to live there?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Yes, I do.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""But, my dear girl, it's an immense house, and will take a power of",Little Women
514,money to keep it in order.  The garden and orchard alone need two or,Little Women
514,"three men, and farming isn't in Bhaer's line, I take it.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""He'll try his hand at it there, if I propose it.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""And you expect to live on the produce of the place?  Well, that sounds",Little Women
514,"paradisiacal, but you'll find it desperate hard work.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""The crop we are going to raise is a profitable one,"" and Jo laughed.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Of what is this fine crop to consist, ma'am?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Boys.  I want to open a school for little lads--a good, happy,",Little Women
514,"homelike school, with me to take care of them and Fritz to teach them.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""That's a truly Joian plan for you!  Isn't that just like her?"" cried",Little Women
514,"Laurie, appealing to the family, who looked as much surprised as he.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I like it,"" said Mrs. March decidedly.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""So do I,"" added her husband, who welcomed the thought of a chance for",Little Women
514,trying the Socratic method of education on modern youth.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""It will be an immense care for Jo,"" said Meg, stroking the head of her",Little Women
514,one all-absorbing son.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Jo can do it, and be happy in it.  It's a splendid idea. Tell us all",Little Women
514,"about it,"" cried Mr. Laurence, who had been longing to lend the lovers",Little Women
514,"a hand, but knew that they would refuse his help.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I knew you'd stand by me, sir.  Amy does too--I see it in her eyes,",Little Women
514,though she prudently waits to turn it over in her mind before she,Little Women
514,"speaks.  Now, my dear people,"" continued Jo earnestly, ""just understand",Little Women
514,"that this isn't a new idea of mine, but a long cherished plan.  Before",Little Women
514,"my Fritz came, I used to think how, when I'd made my fortune, and no",Little Women
514,"one needed me at home, I'd hire a big house, and pick up some poor,",Little Women
514,"forlorn little lads who hadn't any mothers, and take care of them, and",Little Women
514,make life jolly for them before it was too late.  I see so many going,Little Women
514,"to ruin for want of help at the right minute, I love so to do anything",Little Women
514,"for them, I seem to feel their wants, and sympathize with their",Little Women
514,"troubles, and oh, I should so like to be a mother to them!""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Mrs. March held out her hand to Jo, who took it, smiling, with tears in",Little Women
514,"her eyes, and went on in the old enthusiastic way, which they had not",Little Women
514,seen for a long while.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I told my plan to Fritz once, and he said it was just what he would",Little Women
514,"like, and agreed to try it when we got rich.  Bless his dear heart,",Little Women
514,"he's been doing it all his life--helping poor boys, I mean, not getting",Little Women
514,"rich, that he'll never be.  Money doesn't stay in his pocket long",Little Women
514,"enough to lay up any.  But now, thanks to my good old aunt, who loved",Little Women
514,"me better than I ever deserved, I'm rich, at least I feel so, and we",Little Women
514,"can live at Plumfield perfectly well, if we have a flourishing school.",Little Women
514,"It's just the place for boys, the house is big, and the furniture",Little Women
514,"strong and plain.  There's plenty of room for dozens inside, and",Little Women
514,splendid grounds outside. They could help in the garden and orchard.,Little Women
514,"Such work is healthy, isn't it, sir?  Then Fritz could train and teach",Little Women
514,"in his own way, and Father will help him.  I can feed and nurse and pet",Little Women
514,"and scold them, and Mother will be my stand-by.  I've always longed for",Little Women
514,"lots of boys, and never had enough, now I can fill the house full and",Little Women
514,revel in the little dears to my heart's content.  Think what luxury--,Little Women
514,"Plumfield my own, and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"As Jo waved her hands and gave a sigh of rapture, the family went off",Little Women
514,"into a gale of merriment, and Mr. Laurence laughed till they thought",Little Women
514,he'd have an apoplectic fit.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I don't see anything funny,"" she said gravely, when she could be",Little Women
514,"heard.  ""Nothing could be more natural and proper than for my Professor",Little Women
514,"to open a school, and for me to prefer to reside in my own estate.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""She is putting on airs already,"" said Laurie, who regarded the idea in",Little Women
514,"the light of a capital joke.  ""But may I inquire how you intend to",Little Women
514,"support the establishment? If all the pupils are little ragamuffins,",Little Women
514,"I'm afraid your crop won't be profitable in a worldly sense, Mrs.",Little Women
514,"Bhaer.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""Now don't be a wet-blanket, Teddy.  Of course I shall have rich",Little Women
514,"pupils, also--perhaps begin with such altogether.  Then, when I've got",Little Women
514,"a start, I can take in a ragamuffin or two, just for a relish. Rich",Little Women
514,"people's children often need care and comfort, as well as poor. I've",Little Women
514,"seen unfortunate little creatures left to servants, or backward ones",Little Women
514,"pushed forward, when it's real cruelty.  Some are naughty through",Little Women
514,"mismanagment or neglect, and some lose their mothers. Besides, the best",Little Women
514,"have to get through the hobbledehoy age, and that's the very time they",Little Women
514,"need most patience and kindness.  People laugh at them, and hustle them",Little Women
514,"about, try to keep them out of sight, and expect them to turn all at",Little Women
514,once from pretty children into fine young men.  They don't complain,Little Women
514,much--plucky little souls--but they feel it.  I've been through,Little Women
514,"something of it, and I know all about it. I've a special interest in",Little Women
514,"such young bears, and like to show them that I see the warm, honest,",Little Women
514,"well-meaning boys' hearts, in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the",Little Women
514,"topsy-turvy heads.  I've had experience, too, for haven't I brought up",Little Women
514,"one boy to be a pride and honor to his family?""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I'll testify that you tried to do it,"" said Laurie with a grateful",Little Women
514,look.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""And I've succeeded beyond my hopes, for here you are, a steady,",Little Women
514,"sensible businessman, doing heaps of good with your money, and laying",Little Women
514,"up the blessings of the poor, instead of dollars. But you are not",Little Women
514,"merely a businessman, you love good and beautiful things, enjoy them",Little Women
514,"yourself, and let others go halves, as you always did in the old times.",Little Women
514,"I am proud of you, Teddy, for you get better every year, and everyone",Little Women
514,"feels it, though you won't let them say so.  Yes, and when I have my",Little Women
514,"flock, I'll just point to you, and say 'There's your model, my lads'.""",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Poor Laurie didn't know where to look, for, man though he was,",Little Women
514,something of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of praise,Little Women
514,made all faces turn approvingly upon him.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I say, Jo, that's rather too much,"" he began, just in his old boyish",Little Women
514,"way.  ""You have all done more for me than I can ever thank you for,",Little Women
514,except by doing my best not to disappoint you.  You have rather cast me,Little Women
514,"off lately, Jo, but I've had the best of help, nevertheless.  So, if",Little Women
514,"I've got on at all, you may thank these two for it,"" and he laid one",Little Women
514,"hand gently on his grandfather's head, and the other on Amy's golden",Little Women
514,"one, for the three were never far apart.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"""I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the",Little Women
514,"world!"" burst out Jo, who was in an unusually up-lifted frame of mind",Little Women
514,"just then.  ""When I have one of my own, I hope it will be as happy as",Little Women
514,the three I know and love the best.  If John and my Fritz were only,Little Women
514,"here, it would be quite a little heaven on earth,"" she added more",Little Women
514,quietly.  And that night when she went to her room after a blissful,Little Women
514,"evening of family counsels, hopes, and plans, her heart was so full of",Little Women
514,happiness that she could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed,Little Women
514,"always near her own, and thinking tender thoughts of Beth.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It was a very astonishing year altogether, for things seemed to happen",Little Women
514,in an unusually rapid and delightful manner.  Almost before she knew,Little Women
514,"where she was, Jo found herself married and settled at Plumfield.  Then",Little Women
514,"a family of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms, and flourished",Little Women
514,"surprisingly, poor boys as well as rich, for Mr. Laurence was",Little Women
514,"continually finding some touching case of destitution, and begging the",Little Women
514,"Bhaers to take pity on the child, and he would gladly pay a trifle for",Little Women
514,"its support.  In this way, the sly old gentleman got round proud Jo,",Little Women
514,and furnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Of course it was uphill work at first, and Jo made queer mistakes, but",Little Women
514,"the wise Professor steered her safely into calmer waters, and the most",Little Women
514,rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end. How Jo did enjoy her,Little Women
514,"'wilderness of boys', and how poor, dear Aunt March would have lamented",Little Women
514,"had she been there to see the sacred precincts of prim, well-ordered",Little Women
514,"Plumfield overrun with Toms, Dicks, and Harrys!  There was a sort of",Little Women
514,"poetic justice about it, after all, for the old lady had been the",Little Women
514,"terror of the boys for miles around, and now the exiles feasted freely",Little Women
514,"on forbidden plums, kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved,",Little Women
514,and played cricket in the big field where the irritable 'cow with a,Little Women
514,crumpled horn' used to invite rash youths to come and be tossed.  It,Little Women
514,"became a sort of boys' paradise, and Laurie suggested that it should be",Little Women
514,"called the 'Bhaer-garten', as a compliment to its master and",Little Women
514,appropriate to its inhabitants.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"It never was a fashionable school, and the Professor did not lay up a",Little Women
514,"fortune, but it was just what Jo intended it to be--'a happy, homelike",Little Women
514,"place for boys, who needed teaching, care, and kindness'.  Every room",Little Women
514,in the big house was soon full.  Every little plot in the garden soon,Little Women
514,"had its owner.  A regular menagerie appeared in barn and shed, for pet",Little Women
514,"animals were allowed. And three times a day, Jo smiled at her Fritz",Little Women
514,from the head of a long table lined on either side with rows of happy,Little Women
514,"young faces, which all turned to her with affectionate eyes, confiding",Little Women
514,"words, and grateful hearts, full of love for 'Mother Bhaer'.  She had",Little Women
514,"boys enough now, and did not tire of them, though they were not angels,",Little Women
514,"by any means, and some of them caused both Professor and Professorin",Little Women
514,much trouble and anxiety.  But her faith in the good spot which exists,Little Women
514,"in the heart of the naughtiest, sauciest, most tantalizing little",Little Women
514,"ragamuffin gave her patience, skill, and in time success, for no mortal",Little Women
514,boy could hold out long with Father Bhaer shining on him as,Little Women
514,"benevolently as the sun, and Mother Bhaer forgiving him seventy times",Little Women
514,"seven.  Very precious to Jo was the friendship of the lads, their",Little Women
514,"penitent sniffs and whispers after wrongdoing, their droll or touching",Little Women
514,"little confidences, their pleasant enthusiasms, hopes, and plans, even",Little Women
514,"their misfortunes, for they only endeared them to her all the more.",Little Women
514,"There were slow boys and bashful boys, feeble boys and riotous boys,",Little Women
514,"boys that lisped and boys that stuttered, one or two lame ones, and a",Little Women
514,"merry little quadroon, who could not be taken in elsewhere, but who was",Little Women
514,"welcome to the 'Bhaer-garten', though some people predicted that his",Little Women
514,admission would ruin the school.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Yes, Jo was a very happy woman there, in spite of hard work, much",Little Women
514,"anxiety, and a perpetual racket.  She enjoyed it heartily and found the",Little Women
514,"applause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of the world, for",Little Women
514,now she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic believers,Little Women
514,"and admirers.  As the years went on, two little lads of her own came to",Little Women
514,"increase her happiness--Rob, named for Grandpa, and Teddy, a",Little Women
514,"happy-go-lucky baby, who seemed to have inherited his papa's sunshiny",Little Women
514,temper as well as his mother's lively spirit.  How they ever grew up,Little Women
514,alive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and,Little Women
514,"aunts, but they flourished like dandelions in spring, and their rough",Little Women
514,nurses loved and served them well.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"There were a great many holidays at Plumfield, and one of the most",Little Women
514,"delightful was the yearly apple-picking.  For then the Marches,",Little Women
514,"Laurences, Brookes and Bhaers turned out in full force and made a day",Little Women
514,"of it.  Five years after Jo's wedding, one of these fruitful festivals",Little Women
514,"occurred, a mellow October day, when the air was full of an",Little Women
514,exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise and the blood dance,Little Women
514,healthily in the veins.  The old orchard wore its holiday attire.,Little Women
514,Goldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls. Grasshoppers skipped,Little Women
514,"briskly in the sere grass, and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a",Little Women
514,feast.  Squirrels were busy with their small harvesting.  Birds,Little Women
514,"twittered their adieux from the alders in the lane, and every tree",Little Women
514,stood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the,Little Women
514,"first shake.  Everybody was there. Everybody laughed and sang, climbed",Little Women
514,up and tumbled down.  Everybody declared that there never had been such,Little Women
514,"a perfect day or such a jolly set to enjoy it, and everyone gave",Little Women
514,themselves up to the simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there,Little Women
514,were no such things as care or sorrow in the world.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Mr. March strolled placidly about, quoting Tusser, Cowley, and",Little Women
514,"Columella to Mr. Laurence, while enjoying...",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,The gentle apple's winey juice.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,The Professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout,Little Women
514,"Teutonic knight, with a pole for a lance, leading on the boys, who made",Little Women
514,"a hook and ladder company of themselves, and performed wonders in the",Little Women
514,way of ground and lofty tumbling.  Laurie devoted himself to the little,Little Women
514,"ones, rode his small daughter in a bushel-basket, took Daisy up among",Little Women
514,"the bird's nests, and kept adventurous Rob from breaking his neck.",Little Women
514,"Mrs. March and Meg sat among the apple piles like a pair of Pomonas,",Little Women
514,"sorting the contributions that kept pouring in, while Amy with a",Little Women
514,"beautiful motherly expression in her face sketched the various groups,",Little Women
514,"and watched over one pale lad, who sat adoring her with his little",Little Women
514,crutch beside him.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"Jo was in her element that day, and rushed about, with her gown pinned",Little Women
514,"up, and her hat anywhere but on her head, and her baby tucked under her",Little Women
514,"arm, ready for any lively adventure which might turn up.  Little Teddy",Little Women
514,"bore a charmed life, for nothing ever happened to him, and Jo never",Little Women
514,"felt any anxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad,",Little Women
514,"galloped off on the back of another, or supplied with sour russets by",Little Women
514,"his indulgent papa, who labored under the Germanic delusion that babies",Little Women
514,"could digest anything, from pickled cabbage to buttons, nails, and",Little Women
514,their own small shoes.  She knew that little Ted would turn up again in,Little Women
514,"time, safe and rosy, dirty and serene, and she always received him back",Little Women
514,"with a hearty welcome, for Jo loved her babies tenderly.",Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"At four o'clock a lull took place, and baskets remained empty, while",Little Women
514,the apple pickers rested and compared rents and bruises.  Then Jo and,Little Women
514,"Meg, with a detachment of the bigger boys, set forth the supper on the",Little Women
514,"grass, for an out-of-door tea was always the crowning joy of the day.",Little Women
514,"The land literally flowed with milk and honey on such occasions, for",Little Women
514,"the lads were not required to sit at table, but allowed to partake of",Little Women
514,refreshment as they liked--freedom being the sauce best beloved by the,Little Women
514,boyish soul.  They availed themselves of the rare privilege to the,Little Women
514,"fullest extent, for some tried the pleasing experiment of drinking milk",Little Women
514,"while standing on their heads, others lent a charm to leapfrog by",Little Women
514,"eating pie in the pauses of the game, cookies were sown broadcast over",Little Women
514,"the field, and apple turnovers roosted in the trees like a new style of",Little Women
514,"bird.  The little girls had a private tea party, and Ted roved among",Little Women
514,the edibles at his own sweet will.,Little Women
514,,Little Women
514,"When no one could eat any more, the Professor proposed the first",Little Women

514,"the queen of the day with various gifts, so numerous that they were",Little Women
514,"transported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow.  Funny presents,",Little Women
514,"some of them, but what would have been defects to other eyes were",Little Women

514,"sang with all their hearts the little song that Jo had written, Laurie",Little Women
